<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>These pictures of Colonial life and
adventure make up a panorama
which extends from Powhatan and
John Smith, in the days of the
Jamestown colony, to Pontiac’s attempt
upon Detroit in the period which preceded
the Revolution. Here one may read stories
which are strange indeed, of King Philip’s
War in New England, of a Dutch hero’s exploit
on the shores of Long Island Sound, of
conflicts with the fierce Iroquois in the
North, of a young New Englander’s successful
treasure-hunt, and of famous or infamous
pirates of Colonial times. They carry the
reader from a boy’s defence of Fort George in
Nova Scotia to battle against the Natchez at
an advance post of the Louisiana colony. For
the most part these thrilling tales are in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
form of fiction, but it is fiction based upon
historical incidents. The imaginative stories,
and others which are historical narratives,
will, it is believed, illustrate many unfamiliar
dramas in Colonial life, and will help to give
a clearer view of the men and boys who
fought and endured to clear the way for us
upon this continent.</p>

<h1 id="begin">STRANGE STORIES OF<br />
COLONIAL DAYS</h1>

<h2><a name="I" id="I"></a>I<br />
THE CROWNING OF POWHATAN<br />
<i>Adventures in Early Indian History</i></h2>

<p>The first European visitors to the
shores of North America met
with a most friendly reception
from the natives. Powhatan, the
Indian Emperor of Virginia, who ruled in
savage state over twenty-six Indian nations,
on more than one occasion kept the Virginia
colonists from starvation by sending them
corn when they were almost famished. To
retain his good-will a crown was sent over
from England, and the Indian monarch was
crowned with as much ceremony as possible.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
A present from King James of a basin and
ewer, a bed, and some clothes was also brought
to Jamestown, but Powhatan refused to go
there to receive it.</p>

<p>“I also am a King, and gifts should be
brought to me,” said the proud monarch of
the Virginia woods. They were accordingly
taken to him by the colonists.</p>

<p>The coronation was “a sad trouble,” wrote
Captain John Smith, but it had its laughable
side also, as we shall see. Custom required
that the Indian ruler should kneel. Only
by bearing their whole weight upon his
shoulders could the English upon whom this
duty devolved bring the chief from an up-right
position into one suitable to the occasion.
By main force he was made to
kneel.</p>

<p>The firing of a pistol as a signal for a volley
from the boats in honor of the event startled
his copper-colored Majesty. Supposing himself
betrayed, Powhatan at once struck a
defensive attitude, but was soon reassured.
The absurdity of the whole affair reached its
climax when Powhatan gave to the representatives<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
of his royal brother in England
his old moccasins, the deer-skin he used as a
blanket, and a few bushels of corn in the
ear.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>On the New England coast the anger of the
natives had been aroused by the conduct
of visiting sailors, who would persuade them
to come on board their ships, and then carry
them off and sell them into slavery.</p>

<p>One of these natives, named Epanow, “an
Indian of goodly stature, strong, and well
proportioned,” after being exhibited in London
as a curiosity, came into the service of
Sir Ferdinand Gorges, Governor of Plymouth.
This gentleman was much interested
in New England, and was about fitting
out a ship for a voyage to this country.</p>

<p>The Indian soon found out that gold was
the great object of the Englishman’s worship,
and he was cunning enough to take
advantage of the fact. He assured Sir
Ferdinand that in a certain place in his own
country gold was to be had in abundance.
The Englishman believed him, and Epanow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
sailed in Gorges’s vessel to point out the
whereabouts of the supposed gold-mine.</p>

<p>When the ship entered the harbor many
of the natives came on board. Epanow arranged
with them a plan of escape, which
was successfully carried out the next morning.</p>

<p>At the appointed time twenty canoes full
of armed Indians came to within a short
distance of the ship. The captain invited
them to come on board. Epanow had been
clothed in long garments, that he might the
more easily be laid hold of in case he attempted
to escape, and he was also closely guarded
by three of Gorges’s kinsmen.</p>

<p>The critical moment arrived. Epanow
suddenly freed himself from his guards, and
springing over the vessel’s side, succeeded
in reaching his countrymen in safety, though
many shots were fired after him by the
English.</p>

<p>In this affair the European was completely
outwitted by the ignorant savage. Gorges
was bitterly disappointed. Writing of it he
says, “And thus were my hopes of that particular<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
voyage made void and frustrate.”
And thus, we may add, the first gold-hunting
expedition to the coast of Maine “ended
in smoke”&mdash;from the Englishmen’s
guns.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>For many years after the landing of the
Pilgrims at Plymouth the relations of the
English with the Massachusetts Indians were
peaceful. Only once was there any attempt
to disturb them. To try the mettle of the
colonists, Canonicus, the powerful Narragansett
chief, sent them by a messenger a bundle
of arrows wrapped in the skin of a snake&mdash;a
challenge to fight. Governor Bradford returned
the skin filled with powder and shot,
with the message that if they had rather
have war than peace they might begin when
they pleased, he was ready for them. This
prompt defiance impressed the chief. He
would not receive the skin, and wisely concluded
to keep the peace.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>What is known as King Philip’s War broke
out in 1675. Though it lasted but little over a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
year, it was terribly destructive, and it carried
misery to many a hearth-stone.</p>

<p>Philip of Pokanoket, the chief of the
Wampanoags, had for years been suspected
of plotting against the English. He had resisted
all their efforts to convert his people
to Christianity, and had told the venerable
apostle Eliot himself that he cared no more
for the white man’s religion than for the buttons
on his (Eliot’s) coat. On another occasion
he refused to make a treaty with the
Governor of Massachusetts, sending him this
answer:</p>

<p>“Your Governor is but a subject of King
Charles of England. I shall not treat with a
subject. I shall treat of peace only with the
King, my brother. When he comes, I am
ready.”</p>

<p>On the morning of April 10, 1671, the
meeting-house on Taunton Green presented
a scene of extraordinary interest. Seated on
the benches upon one side of the house were
Philip and his warriors, and on the other side
were the white men. Both parties were
equipped for battle. The Indians looked as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
formidable as possible in their war-paint,
their hair “trimmed up in comb fashion,”
with their long bows and quivers of arrows,
and here and there a gun in the hands of
those best skilled in its use. The English
wore the costume of Cromwell, with broad-brimmed
hats, cuirasses, long swords, and
unwieldly guns. Each party looked at the
other with unconcealed hatred.</p>

<p>The result of this conference was that the
Indians agreed to give up all their guns, and
Philip, upon his part, also promised to send
a yearly tribute of five wolves’ heads&mdash;“If he
could get them.”</p>

<p>As the Indians had almost forgotten how
to use their old weapons, the taking of their
fire-arms away was a serious grievance.
Other causes of enmity arose, and at last the
war begun, which in its course caused the
destruction of thirteen towns and hundreds
of valuable lives.</p>

<p>Philip was joined by the Nipmucks, as the
Indians of the interior were called, and by
the Narragansetts, whose stronghold was
captured in the winter of 1675-76. Here<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
seven hundred of this hapless tribe perished
by fire or the sword. The death of Philip,
in August, 1676, ended the war. Many of
the Indians fled to the west, and a large
number died in slavery in the West Indies.
The power of the Indians of southern New
England was broken forever.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Captain Benjamin Church, a prominent
actor in this war, was the most celebrated
Indian fighter of his day. One of his most
remarkable feats was the capture of Annawan,
Philip’s chief captain. Annawan often
said that he would never be taken by the
English.</p>

<p>Informed by a captured Indian where
Annawan lay, Church, with only one other
Englishman and a few friendly Indians, succeeded
in gaining the rear of the Indian
camp.</p>

<p>The approach to this secluded spot was
extremely difficult. It was nearly dark when
they reached it, and the Indians were preparing
their evening meal. A little apart
from the others, and within easy reach of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
guns of the party, the chief and his son were
reclining on the ground. An old squaw was
pounding corn in a mortar, the noise of which
prevented the discovery of Church’s approach,
as he and his companions cautiously
lowered themselves from rock to rock. They
were preceded by an old Indian and his
daughter, whom they had captured, and
who, with their baskets at their backs, aided
in concealing their approach.</p>

<p>By these skilful tactics Church succeeded
in placing himself between the chief and the
guns, seeing which, Annawan suddenly started
up with the cry, “Howoh!” (“I am
taken.”) Perceiving that he was surrounded,
he made no attempt to escape.</p>

<p>After securing the arms, Church sent his
Indian scouts among Annawan’s men to tell
them that their chief was captured, and that
Church with his great army had entrapped
them, and would cut them to pieces unless
they surrendered. This they accordingly did,
and, on the promise of kind treatment, gave up
all their arms. This well-executed surprise
was the closing event of King Philip’s War.</p>

<h2><a name="II" id="II"></a>II<br />
CORNELIS LABDEN’S LEAP<br />
<i>A Legend of 1645 Retold</i></h2>

<p>The scene was only thirty miles
from New York, on the shores of
Long Island Sound. At the time
of which we write it was a sweep
of dense forest.</p>

<p>Outside of the block-house, built where
the Myanos River enters a bay of the Sound,
one September day in 1645 walked two elderly
men, grizzled of beard and soldierly in
bearing. Broadswords swung from their
cross-belts and huge pistolets were stuck in
their girdles. These were famous fighting
men in New England history, Daniel Patrick
and John Underhill. Bred to camps, they
had chafed under Puritan laws, and had
finally deserted the older settlements. Indeed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
Captain Patrick had been the leader of
the little colony which had made this beautiful
place its home.</p>

<p>“I tell thee, John, I trust not the savage
any longer. Ponus hath been as surly as a
bear with a sore head of late. I fear the
Sagamore plots evil.”</p>

<p>“Belike you are right, good Captain,” said
Underhill, “and we must match craft with
craft.”</p>

<p>“Rumor hath it, too,” said Captain Patrick,
with growing trouble on his face, “that
strange runners have been back and forth
during the month at the Sinoway village.
We cannot look to our English friends for
help, since we signed the pact with his Excellency
Governor Kieft, accepting the rule
of New Netherland. If an outbreak occurs,
it must be from the Manhattans that relief
will come. But look! there rides Dutch
Cornelis with a bale of peltries to his crupper.”</p>

<p>Among a few Dutch who mingled with the
English of the settlement was Cornelis Labden,
a bold hunter and trapper, who, unlike<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
the rest of the colonists, got his livelihood by
the fur-trade. He sold his pelts at the
Dutch trading-post about seven miles west,
just over the line which now separates New
York from Connecticut. Thither he was
riding when accosted by the two captains.
Cornelis was noted for his daring and skill
in woodcraft, and had always lived on specially
friendly terms with the Indians, as
was, indeed, his interest. His log house was
built on the brow of a great precipice of
beetling rock one hundred feet or more in
height, in the heart of a gloomy forest two
miles from the outskirts of the settlement.
The spot is still known as Labden’s Rock,
and the writer has shot many a squirrel
there in woods still solemn with deepest
shadow. Here Cornelis lived with his English
wife and two children, Hans and Anneke.</p>

<p>“Well met, Cornelis,” said Patrick. “We
were holding counsel concerning our Indian
neighbors. What think you of their peaceful
purpose?”</p>

<p>The Dutchman shook his head. He was a
man of few words. “Der outlook ist pad,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
Cabdain. Dot yoong Gief Owenoke say to
me toder day, ‘Cornelis, Indian’s friend, bedder
go ’way. Indian very angry at bale-faces.’

<p>“You are bound, I suppose, to Byram
Fort with your peltries. Tarry awhile, and
carry me a letter for the Governor. I will
write it forthwith.” Captain Patrick disappeared
in the block-house, and wrote to the
Dutch Governor as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“<i>To his Excellency, Wilhelm Kieft, Governor-General of New Netherland
at New Amsterdam, greeting</i>:</p>

<p>“This in haste:&mdash;Whereas it cometh to me with
some surety that the savages on our border plot an
early outbreak, I would urge that a company of
musketeers be sent to the trading-post at Byram to
protect the outlying country. Thence sure help
may reach this settlement. Once the savages
break loose they will ravage the region for many
miles with torch and tomahawk. I would entreat
your Excellency to act right speedily in this affair.
Cornelis Labden, who is well skilled in Indian matters,
bears this letter.</p>

<p class="ralign smcap">“Daniel Patrick.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
It will be seen by this that Captain Patrick
did not share the confidence of Cornelis.
But all the people were very busy afield at
that time gathering their crops, and they
were loath to think that danger was pressing.
The women and children, however, were
gathered every night in the block-house. It
may be that this measure of care on the part
of the settlers quickened the action of the
Indians in the fear that their purpose had
been discovered. Within three days the
outbreak came. The forest was glowing
with all the rich hues of autumn, when
through its arches burst at different points
bands of naked warriors, painted with as
many colors as the leaves themselves, and
yelling their shrill war-whoops. Every colonist
amid the yellowing corn-stalks of the
fields had his firelock close at hand. They
all skirmished back through this cover and
across the rye and buckwheat stubble towards
the block-house, firing and loading as
they ran. Yet several fell under the cloud
of arrows before the fugitives reached the
little fort. The two captains, each with a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
party of men, charged the savages fiercely
on either flank as they leaped into the open,
and drove them back with heavy loss. The
settlers then withdrew behind the palisades,
awaiting attack.</p>

<p>The red besiegers, having exhausted their
arts of attack and met with heavy loss, for
musket-balls told with terrible effect against
flint arrows, determined to starve out the
little garrison. It was on the morning of the
third day that a rider galloped furiously
from the west to the bank of the Myanos,
where the log bridge had been destroyed by
the Indians. Dutch Cornelis had ridden
daringly through the midst of them. A band
of howling braves swarmed almost at his
horse’s tail. He leaped his beast into the
river amid the whizzing arrows, several of
which stung both steed and rider sharply.
Captain Underhill, with a score of colonists,
sallied out from the palisades, driving the
redskins from their front and opening a
heavy fire on those lining the opposite bank.
Under cover of this Cornelis landed safely.
He had been sent on from Byram to New<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
Amsterdam with Patrick’s letter, and it was
only by hard spurring that he had made such
speed in return. He brought the good news
that even then a company of Dutch musketeers
was on the march.</p>

<p>The women and children trooped out of
the block-house to hear the tidings. Cornelis
cast his eyes over them with agony stamped
on his usually stolid face.</p>

<p>“Mein vrouw! mein gildren!” the Dutchman
groaned. “What for you leave dem
to de mercy of de savage?” with a look
of fierce reproach at the two English captains.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<p class="caption">“MEIN VROUW! MEIN GILDREN!” THE DUTCHMAN GROANED</p>
</div>

<p>“Nay! nay! Cornelis, blame us not,” they
answered, almost in a breath. “We were
sharp beset. ’Twas not easy to gather in all
the outlying people in season. There be
others as well not saved in the block. The
savage, too, is far more friendly to you
than to us English. There’s right good
hope that at the worst the lost are but captives.”</p>

<p>This cold comfort seemed to madden the
bereaved man. Muttering to himself in his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
own tongue, and darting wild looks around,
as if his brain were turned and he were about
to run amuck, he suddenly sprang on his
horse, which panted there, fagged and dripping.</p>

<p>“Oben der gate!” he shouted, in a tone so
commanding that, though several tried to
seize his horse’s head by the bit, fearing
some act of desperate folly, others unbarred
the entrance. Cornelis dashed through as
swiftly as an Indian arrow. Two miles of
clearing and forest lay between him and his
cabin. The way was thick with savages
thirsting for blood. Cornelis spurred on,
numb to all sense of danger. The smoke
even yet curled from the embers of smouldering
homesteads at every turn. But he saw
only one house in his mind’s eye&mdash;that was
a cabin perched in the midst of a clearing
on top of a great rock, with flames bursting
from its roof; he heard but one sound&mdash;the
shrieking of wife and children in their last
peril.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was the wild gestures of the
rider, signalling as if to unseen beings, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
motions of a maniac, which barred any pursuit
at the outset, for the American Indian
as well as the Mohammedan of the East fancies
the madman under the protection of
God; perhaps it was that many of the savages
felt more kindly to Cornelis than to
other whites. It was not till he neared the
base of the precipice, on the crest of which
he had built his home, that he saw six Indians
on his track, leaping at a pace which
outran the strides of his weary horse.</p>

<p>The Dutchman turned in his saddle, and
his unerring aim dropped one of the pursuers;
then he urged his way amid the gloom of
the great trees up the hill. When he gained
the clearing at the top he saw what had once
been his happy home, now only a pile of cold
ashes and half-charred logs. He had no time
to search if by chance there might yet remain
some ghastly relic of those he had loved and
lost. The red men were upon him, running
as fleetly as stag-hounds, for now they were
on the level.</p>

<p>They were sure of their prey. A triumphant
whoop rang out. Tomahawks whizzed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
through the air, one of them striking Cornelis
in the shoulder, as the savages pressed
on at top speed. The white man laughed
loud and long with a laughter that filled
the forest with shrill echoes, and motioning
to them as if he were their leader, leaped
his horse from the top of the terrible rock,
crashing through the branches of trees
down, down a hundred feet. The human
hounds so hot in the chase were going with
a rush which could not be stayed, and they
too plunged to death in the pathway of their
victim. Cornelis escaped with broken limbs,
though his horse was killed, and all the
Indians perished but one, who saved himself
by clutching at the limb of a tree. He fled
and carried the story to his tribe.</p>

<p>With the coming of the Dutch soldiers the
settlers were strong enough to scatter their
assailants. But most of the colonists, discouraged,
drifted away to the New Netherlands
or to the more easterly settlements. It
was not till two years later that a force of
Dutch and English stormed the Sinoway
village and crushed the power of the tribe,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
after which the town was successfully settled.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Ten years have passed. The skill and toil
of the whites have swept away the scars of
Indian warfare. Pleasant homes rise amid
smiling fields of maize and rye. One summer
day, Cornelis Labden, a helpless cripple and
almost half-witted, sat on the porch of Captain
Underhill’s house, smoking his long
Dutch pipe and looking at the shining waters
of the Sound. Here or in the good Captain’s
hearth-corner he would doze and mumble all
day long summer and winter. An Indian
youth, nearly grown, walked up the lane
and stood before this poor wreck of a man.
Cornelis shut his eyes, and waved him off as
if to drive away some thought that troubled
his weak brain.</p>

<p>“Lapten, me find Lapten,” said the Indian,
whose blue eyes and brown hair were queerly
amiss with the copper skin, the breech-clout,
and the moccasins of the savage.</p>

<p>The sound of the voice stirred Cornelis
strangely, and as if by some instinct he spoke<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
in Dutch. The lad listened eagerly, for the
words seemed to be half known to him, and
he repeated them. Cornelis watched him
with an intent look, like the gaze of one just
awakened from a long sleep. He trembled,
and for the first time in years intelligence
burned in his eyes. Without another word
he led the Indian lad within and began to
rub the skin of his face with soap and water,
and in a few moments the clear white was
shown. While he was thus engaged over the
unresisting youth, Captain Underhill entered.</p>

<p>“Cabdain, Cabdain,” said Cornelis, with a
shaking voice, “mein Hans ist goom back.
Done ye know yer old vader, leedle Hans?
Vare ist Anneke?” And he threw his arms
with a passion of sobs about the lad’s neck.
This opened the gates of memory for father
and son, and the identity was soon made
clear. In recovering his son, Dutch Cornelis
had also regained his reason.</p>

<p>By gradual questioning, the facts were fully
obtained as the half-forgotten language of
childhood came back. Hans and Anneke had
been carried off by strange Indians of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
more northern tribes, who had sent warriors
to join in the Sinoway attack. The children
had been separated, and Anneke was lost
forever. As Hans grew up, forgetting much,
he still remembered his father’s name and his
white blood. He had finally escaped from his
adopted tribe, and worked his way by a
strange series of accidents and guesses back
to the place of his birth. Such, in the main,
is the legend of Labden’s Rock.</p>

<h2><a name="III" id="III"></a>III<br />
TOMMY TEN-CANOES<br />
<i>A Tale of King Philip’s Scout</i></h2>

<p>There once lived in New York an
Indian warrior by the name of
Peter Twenty-Canoes. Tommy
Ten-Canoes lived in New England,
at Pokanoket, near Mount Hope, on an arm
of the Mount Hope Bay.</p>

<p>He was not a warrior, but a runner; not
a great naval hero, as his picturesque name
might suggest, but a news agent, as it were;
he used his nimble feet and his ten canoes to
bear messages to the Indians of the villages
of Pokanoket and to the Narragansetts, and,
it may be, to other friendly tribes.</p>

<p>Pokanoket? You may have read Irving’s
sketch of Philip of Pokanoket, but we doubt
if you have in mind any clear idea of this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
beautiful region, from whose clustering wigwams
the curling smoke once rose among
the giant oaks along the many waterways.
The former site of Pokanoket is now covered
by Bristol and Warren (Rhode Island) and
Swansea (Massachusetts). It is a place of
bays and rivers, which were once rich fishing-grounds;
of shores full of shells and shellfish;
of cool springs and wild-grape vines;
of bowery hills; and of meadows that were
once yellow with maize.</p>

<p>Tommy Ten-Canoes was a great man in his
day. As a news agent in peace he was held
in high honor, but as a scout in war and a
runner for the great chiefs he became a heroic
figure. There were great osprey’s nests all
about the shores of old Pokanoket on the
ancient decayed trees, and Tommy made a
crown of osprey feathers, and crowned himself,
with the approval of the great Indian
chiefs.</p>

<p>Once when swimming with this crown of
feathers on his head, he had been shot at by
an Englishman, who thought him some new
and remarkable bird. But while his crown<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
was shattered, it was not the crown of his
head. He was very careful of both his
crowns after that alarming event.</p>

<p>Tommy Ten-Canoes was a brave man.
He was ready to face any ordinary danger
for his old chief Massasoit, and for that
chief’s two sons, Wamsutta (Alexander) and
Pomebacen (Philip). He would cross the
Mount Hope or the Narragansett bay in
tempestuous weather. He used to convey
the beautiful Queen Weetamoc from Pocassett
to Mount Hope to attend Philip’s war-dances
under the summer moons, and when
the old Indian war began he offered his two
swift legs and all of his ten canoes to the
service of his chief.</p>

<p>“Nipanset”&mdash;for this was his Indian name&mdash;“Nipanset’s
bosom is his chief’s, and it
knows not fear. Nipanset fears not the
storm or the foe, or the gun of the pale-face.
Call, call, O ye chiefs; in the hour of danger
call for Nipanset. Nipanset fears not death.”</p>

<p>So Tommy Ten-Canoes boasted at the great
council under the moss-covered cliff at Mount
Hope.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
He was honest; but there was one thing
that Nipanset, or Tommy Ten-Canoes, did
fear. It was enchantment. He would have
faced torture or death without a word, but
everything mysterious filled him with terror.
If he had thought that a bush contained a
hidden enemy and flintlock, he would have
been very brave; but had he thought that
the same bush was stirred by a spirit, or was
enchanted, he would have run.</p>

<p>Tommy Ten-Canoes had been friendly to
the white people who had settled in Pokanoket.
There was a family by the name of
Brown, who lived on Cole’s River, that he
especially liked, and he became a companion
of one of the sons named James. The two
were so often together that the people used
to speak of those who were very intimate as
being “as <em>thick</em> as little James Brown and old
Tommy Ten-Canoes,” or rather as “Jemmie
Brown” and our young hero of the many
birch boats.</p>

<p>The two hunted and fished together; they
made long journeys together; in fact, they
did everything in common, except work.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
Tommy did not work, at least in the field,
while James did at times, when he was not
with Tommy.</p>

<p>When the Indian war began, King Philip
sent word to the Brown family, and also to
the Cole family, who lived near them, both
of whom had treated him justly and generously,
that he would do all in his power
to protect them, but that he might not be
able to restrain his braves.</p>

<p>Tommy Ten-Canoes brought a like friendly
message to Jemmie Brown.</p>

<p>“I will always be true to you,” he said;
“true as the north wind to the river, the
west wind to the sea, and the south wind to
the flowers. Nipanset’s heart is true to his
friends. Our hearts will see each other
again.”</p>

<p>The Indian torch swept the settlements.
One of the bravest scouts in these dark
scenes was Tommy Ten-Canoes. He flew
from place to place like the wind, carrying
news and spying out the enemy.</p>

<p>Tommy grew proud over his title of “Ten-Canoes.”
He felt like ten Tommies. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
wore his crown of osprey feathers like a royal
king. His ten canoes ferried the painted
Indians at night, and carried the chiefs
hither and thither.</p>

<p>There was a grizzly old Boston Captain,
who had done hard service on the sea,
named Moseley. He wore a wig, a thing
that the Indians had never seen, and of
whose use they knew nothing at all.</p>

<p>Tommy Ten-Canoes had never feared the
white man nor the latter’s death-dealing
weapons. He had never retreated; he had
always been found in front of the stealthy
bands as they pursued the forest trails. But
his courage was at last put to a test of which
he had never dreamed.</p>

<p>Old Captain Moseley had led a company
of trained soldiers against the Indians from
Boston. Tommy Ten-Canoes had discovered
the movement, and had prepared the Indians
to meet it. Captain Moseley’s company,
which consisted of one hundred men, had
first marched to a place called Myles Bridge
in Swansea. Here was a garrison house in
which lived Rev. John Myles. The church<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
was called Baptist, but people of all faiths
were welcome to it; among the latter,
Marinus Willett, who afterwards became the
first Mayor of New York. It was the first
church of the kind in Massachusetts, and it
still exists in Swansea.</p>

<p>Over the glimmering waterways walled
with dark oak woods came Tommy Ten-Canoes,
with five of his famous boats, and
landed at a place near the thrifty Baptist
colony, so that his little navy might be at
the ready service of Philip. It was the last
days of June. There had been an eclipse of
the moon on the night that Tommy Ten-Canoes
had glided up the Sowans River
towards Myles Bridge. He thought the
eclipse was meant for him and his little
boats, and he was a very proud and happy
man.</p>

<p>“The moon went out in the clear sky when
we left the bay,” said he; “so shall our
enemies be extinguished. The moon shone
again on the calm river. For whom did the
moon shine again? For Nipanset.”</p>

<p>Poor Tommy Ten-Canoes! He was not the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
first hero of modern times who has thought
that the moon and stars were made for him
and shone for him on special occasions.</p>

<p>In old Captain Moseley’s company was a
Jamaica pilot who had visited Pokanoket
and been presented to Tommy, and told that
the latter was a very renowned Indian.</p>

<p>“<em>What</em> are you?” asked the Pilot.</p>

<p>“I am Tommy One-Canoe.”</p>

<p>“Ah!”</p>

<p>“I am Tommy Two-Canoes.”</p>

<p>“Indeed! Ah!”</p>

<p>“I am Tommy Three-Canoes.”</p>

<p>“Oh! Ah! Indeed!”</p>

<p>“I am Tommy Four-Canoes, <em>and</em> I am
Tommy Five-Canoes, <em>and</em> I am Tommy Six-Canoes,
<em>and</em> I am Tommy <em class="smcap">Ten</em>-Canoes.”</p>

<p>“Well, Tommy Ten-Canoes,” said the
Pilot, “don’t you ever get into any trouble
with the white people, because you might
find yourself merely Tommy No-Canoes.”</p>

<p>Tommy was offended at this. He had
no fears of such a fall from power, however.</p>

<p>The old Jamaica pilot had taken a boat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
and drifted down the Sowans River one long
June day, when he chanced to discover
Tommy and his five canoes. The canoes
were hauled up on the shore under the cool
trees which overshadowed the water. The
Pilot, who had with him three men, rowed
boldly to the shore and surprised Tommy
Ten-Canoes, who had gone into the wood,
leaving his weapons in one of his canoes.</p>

<p>The Pilot seized the canoe with the weapons
and drew it from the shore.</p>

<p>Tommy Ten-Canoes beheld the movement
with astonishment. He called to the old
Pilot, “I am Tommy Ten-Canoes!”</p>

<p>“No, no,” answered the Pilot. “You are
Tommy Nine-Canoes.”</p>

<p>Presently the Pilot drew from the shore
another canoe. Tommy called again:</p>

<p>“Don’t you know me? I am&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Tommy Eight-Canoes,” said the Pilot.</p>

<p>Another boat was removed in like manner,
and the Pilot shouted, “And now you are
Tommy Seven-Canoes.” Another, and the
Pilot called again, “Now you are Tommy
Six-Canoes.” Another. “Good-bye, Tommy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
Five-Canoes,” said the Pilot, and he and his
men drew all of the light canoes after them
up the river.</p>

<p class="caption">“GOOD-BYE, TOMMY FIVE-CANOES”</p>
</div>

<p>Xerxes at Salamis could hardly have felt
more crushed in heart than Tommy Ten-Canoes.
But hope revived; he was Tommy Five-Canoes
still. He was not quite so sure
now, however, that the moon on that still
June night had been eclipsed expressly for
him.</p>

<p>The scene of the war now changed to the
western border, as the towns of Hadley and
Deerfield were called, for these towns in that
day were the “great west,” as afterwards was
the Ohio Reserve. Tommy having lost five of
his canoes, now used his swift feet as a messenger.
He still had hopes of doing great
deeds, else why had the moon been eclipsed
on that beautiful June night?</p>

<p>But an event followed the loss of his five
canoes that quite changed his opinion. As
a messenger or runner he had hurried to the
scene of the brutal conflicts on the border,
and had there discovered that Captain Moseley,
the old Jamaica pirate, was subject to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
some spell of enchantment; that he had two
heads.</p>

<p>“Ugh! ugh! him no good!” said one of the
Indians to Tommy; “he take off his head
and put him in his pocket. It is no use to
fight him. Spell set on him&mdash;enchanted.”</p>

<p>Tommy Ten-Canoes’ fear of the man with
two heads, one of which he sometimes took
off and put in his pocket, spread among the
Indians. One day in a skirmish Tommy saw
Moseley take off one of his enchanted heads
and hang it on a blueberry bush. Other Indians
saw it. “No scalp him,” said they.
“Run!” And run they did, not from the
open foe, but from the supposed head on the
bush. Moseley did not dream at the time
that it was his wig that had given him the
victory.</p>

<p>Across the Mount Hope Bay, among the
sunny headlands of Pocassett, there was an
immense cedar swamp, cool and dark, and in
summer full of fire-flies. Tommy Ten-Canoes
called it the swamp of the fire-flies. It was
directly opposite Pokanoket, across the placid
water. A band of Indians gathered there,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
and covered their bodies with bushes, so
that they might not be discovered on the
shore.</p>

<p>One moonlight night in September Tommy
went to visit these masked Indians in four of
his canoes. He rowed one of his canoes, and
three squaws the others. On reaching the
fire-fly cedar swamp the party met the
masked Indians, and late at night retired to
rest, the three Indian squaws sleeping on the
shore under their three canoes.</p>

<p>Captain Moseley had sent the old Jamaica
pilot to try to discover the hiding-place of
this mysterious band of Indians. The Pilot
had seen the four canoes crossing the bay
from Pokanoket under the low September
moon, and had hurried with a dozen men to
the place of landing. He surprised the party
early the next morning, when they were disarmed
and asleep.</p>

<p>The crack of his musket rang out in the
clear air over the bay. A naked Indian was
seen to leap up.</p>

<p>“Stop! I am Tommy Ten-Canoes.”</p>

<p>“No, Tommy Five-Canoes,” answered the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
Pilot; “and now you are only Tommy Four-Canoes.”
Saying which, the Pilot seized the
<em>sixth</em> canoe.</p>

<p>A shriek followed; another, and another.
Three canoes hidden in the river-weeds were
overturned, and three Indian squaws were
seen running into the dark swamp.</p>

<p>“And now you are Tommy Three-Canoes,”
said the Pilot, seizing the seventh canoe.
“And now Tommy Two-Canoes,” seizing the
eighth.</p>

<p>“And only Tommy One-Canoe,” taking
possession of the ninth canoe. “And now
you are Tommy No-Canoes, as I told you you
would be if you went to war,” said the Pilot,
taking according to this odd reckoning the
Indian’s last canoe.</p>

<p>But Tommy had one canoe left, notwithstanding
the dark Pilot had taken his <em>tenth</em>.
He was glad that it was not here. It would
have been his <em>eleventh</em> canoe, although he had
but ten. He knew that the Pilot was one of
Moseley’s men, the Captain who put his head
at times in his pocket or hung it upon a
bush. Poor Tommy Ten-Canoes! He uttered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
a shriek, like the fugitive squaws, and
fled.</p>

<p>“Don’t shoot at him,” said the old Pilot to
his men. “I have taken from him all of his
ten canoes; let him go.”</p>

<p>Tommy had not a mathematical mind or
education, but he knew that somehow he
had no eleventh canoe, and that one of his
ten canoes yet remained. And even the old
Pilot must have at last seen that his count of
ten was only nine. Tommy fled to a point
on the Titicut River at which he could swim
across, and then made his solitary way back
to the shores of Pokanoket and to his remaining
canoe, which did not belong to mathematics.</p>

<p>One morning late in September Tommy
Ten-Canoes turned his solitary canoe towards
Cole’s River, near which lived his boy friend,
James Brown. He paddled slowly, and late
in the dreamy afternoon reached the shore
opposite the Brown farm. He landed and
tied his one canoe to Jemmie Brown’s boat,
in which the two had spent many happy
hours before the war.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
The canoe was found there the next day;
but Tommy Ten-Canoes? He was never seen
again; he probably sought a grave in the
waters of the bay.</p>

<p>But he had fulfilled his promise. He had
been true in his heart as “the north wind to
the river, the west wind to the sea, and the
south wind to the flowers.”</p>

JONATHAN’S ESCAPE<br />
<i>A Young Hero of Hadley who Fought at Turner’s
Falls in 1676</i></h2>

<p>Though the Indians of New England
were for many years vastly
superior in numbers to the white
men, they were never wholly
united, and their cowardice and lack of
discipline were weaknesses for which their
treachery and deceit could not compensate.
The long conflict between the races culminated
in 1675 in King Philip’s War, when
the wily Wampanoag sachem succeeded in
forming a confederation, embracing nearly
all the New England tribes, for a final
desperate struggle.</p>

<p>It seemed for a time as though the combination
might succeed. At the end of the summer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
the scattered settlements, and especially
those along the Connecticut River, which
formed the outposts of the colonies, were
panic-stricken. Everywhere the savage allies
had been victorious. A dozen towns had
been attacked and burned, bands of soldiers
had been cut off, and isolated murders without
number had been committed. Prowling
bands of Indians lurked about the stockaded
towns, driving off cattle and rendering impossible
the cultivation of the fields, so that
the settlers were called upon to face starvation
as well as the scalping-knife and tomahawk.</p>

<p>There was no meeting the Indians face to
face, except by surprise. They fought from
ambush, or by sudden assault on unprotected
points, and would be gone before troops could
be brought to the scene. The white men
were unable to follow them without Indian
allies, and they were slow to adapt themselves
to the Indian mode of fighting. Flushed
by their success, the confederates became
overconfident, and grew to despise their
clumsy opponents. In the spring of 1676<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
more than five thousand of them were encamped
on the Connecticut River, twenty
miles north of Hadley. Here they planted
their corn and squashes, and amused themselves
with councils, ceremonies, and feasts,
boasting of what they had done and what
they would do. They judged the white men
by themselves, and did not suspect the iron
courage and stubborn determination that
were urging the people in the towns below
them “to be out against the enemy.” On
the night of May 18th they indulged in a
great feast, and after it was over, slept
soundly in their bark lodges, all but the
wary Philip, who, scenting danger, had withdrawn
across the river.</p>

<p>On that same evening about two hundred
and fifty men and boys gathered in Hadley
street. Of this number fifty-six were soldiers
from the garrisons of Hadley, Northampton,
Springfield, Hatfield, and Westfield.
The rest were volunteers, among whom was
Jonathan Wells, of Hadley, sixteen years old,
whose adventures and miraculous escape
have been preserved.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
The party was under the command of
Captain William Turner, and the expedition
which it was about to undertake was inspired
by a daring amounting to rashness. The
plan was to attack the Indian camp, which
contained four times their number of well-armed
braves. Defeat meant death, or captivity
and torture worse than death. The
march began after nightfall so as not to
attract the attention of the Indian scouts,
and the little band made its way safely
through swamps and forests, past the Indian
outposts, and at daybreak arrived in the
neighborhood of the camp. Here the horses
were left under a small guard among the
trees, while the men crept forward to the
lodges of the enemy.</p>

<p>The surprise was complete. The panic-stricken
savages, crying that the dreaded
Mohawks were upon them, were shot down
by scores, or, plunging into the river, were
swept over the falls which now bear Captain
Turner’s name. The backbone of Philip’s
conspiracy was broken, and he himself was
driven to begin soon afterwards the hunted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
wanderings which were to end in the fatal
morass.</p>

<p>But the attacking party, though victorious,
was not yet out of danger. It was still
heavily outnumbered by the surviving Indians.
While the soldiers were destroying
arms, ammunition, and food, or scattered in
pursuit of the fleeing enemy, the warriors
rallied, and opened fire upon them from
under cover of the trees. Captain Turner
became alarmed and ordered a retreat. The
main body hastily mounted and plunged into
the forest, seeking to shake off the cloud of
savages who hung upon their flanks like a
swarm of angry bees.</p>

<p>Young Jonathan was with a detachment of
about twenty who were some distance up the
river when the retreat began. They ran back
to the horses and found their comrades gone.
The Indians pressed upon them in numbers
they could not hope to withstand. It was
every man for himself. In the confusion the
boy kept his wits about him, and managed to
find his horse. As he plunged forward under
the branches three Indians levelled their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
pieces and fired. One shot passed through
his hair, another struck his horse, and the
third entered his thigh, splintering the bone
where it had been broken by a cart-wheel
and never properly healed. He reeled, and
would have fallen had he not clutched the
mane of his horse. The Indians, seeing that
he was wounded, pursued him, but he pointed
his gun at them, and held them at bay until
he was out of their reach. As he galloped on
he heard a cry for help, and reining in his
horse, regardless of the danger which encompassed
him, found Stephen Belding, a boy of
his own age, lying sorely wounded on the
ground. He managed to pull him up behind,
and they rode double until they overtook the
party in advance. This brave act saved
Belding’s life.</p>

<p>The retreat had become a rout. All was
panic and dismay; but Jonathan was unwilling
to desert the comrades left behind.
He sought out Captain Turner, and begged
him to halt and turn back to their relief.
“It is better to save some than to lose all,”
was the Captain’s answer. The confusion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
increased, and to add to it the guides became
bewildered and lost their way. “If you love
your lives, follow me!” cried one. “If you
would see your homes again! follow me,”
shouted another, and the party was soon
split up into small bands. The one with
which Jonathan found himself became entangled
in a swamp, where it was once more
attacked by the Indians. He escaped again,
with ten others, who, finding that his horse
was going lame from his wound, and that he
himself was weak from loss of blood, left him
with another wounded man and rode away.
His companion, thinking the boy’s hurt
worse than his own, concluded that he would
stand a better chance of getting clear alone,
and riding off on pretence of seeking the path,
failed to return. Jonathan was now wholly
deserted. Wounded, ignorant even of the
direction of his home, surrounded by bloodthirsty
Indians, and weak with hunger, he
pushed desperately on. He was near fainting
once, when he heard some Indians running
about and whooping near by; but they
did not discover him, and a nutmeg which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
he had in his pocket revived him for a
time.</p>

<p>After straying some distance farther he
swooned in good earnest, and fell from his
horse. When he came to he found that he
had retained his hold on the reins, and that
the animal stood quietly beside him. He
tied him to a tree, and lay down again; but
he soon grew so weak that he abandoned all
hope of escape, and out of pity loosed the
horse and let him go. He succeeded in kindling
a fire by flashing powder in the pan of
his gun. It spread in the dry leaves and
burned his hands and face severely. Feeling
sure that the Indians would be attracted by
the smoke and come and kill him, he threw
away his powder-horn and bullets, keeping
only ammunition for a single shot. Then he
stopped his wound with tow, bound it up
with his neckcloth, and went to sleep.</p>

<p>In the morning he found that the bleeding
had stopped and that he was much stronger.
He managed to find a path which led him to
a river which he remembered to have crossed
on the way to the camp. With great pain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
and difficulty, leaning on his gun, the lock
of which he was careful to keep dry, he waded
through it, and fell exhausted on the farther
bank. While he lay there an Indian in a
canoe appeared, and the boy, who could
neither fight nor run, gave himself up for
lost. But he remembered the three Indians
in the woods, and putting a bold face on the
matter, aimed his gun, though its barrel was
choked with sand. The savage, thinking he
was about to shoot, leaped overboard, leaving
his own gun in the canoe, and ran to tell
his friends that the white men were coming
again.</p>

<p>Jonathan knew that pursuit was certain,
and as it was broad daylight, and he could
only hobble at best, he assured himself that
there was no hope for him. Nevertheless he
looked about for a hiding-place, and presently,
a little distance away, noticed two trees
which, undermined by the current, had fallen
forward into the stream close together. A
mass of driftwood had lodged on their trunks.
Jonathan got back into the water so as to
leave no tracks, and creeping between the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
trunks under the driftwood, found a space
large enough to permit him to breathe. In
a few minutes the Indians arrived in search
of him, as he had expected. They ransacked
the whole neighborhood, even running out
upon the mat of driftwood over his head,
and causing the trees to sink with their weight
so as to thrust his head under water; but
they could find no trace of him, and at last
retired, completely outwitted.</p>

<p>The boy limped on, tortured by hunger
and thirst, and so giddy with weakness that
he could proceed but a short distance without
stopping to rest. Happily he saw no
more of the Indians, and at last, on the third
day of his painful journey, he arrived at
Hadley, where he was welcomed as one risen
from the dead.</p>

<p>The story of his escape was told for years
around the wide fireplaces throughout the
country-side, and was thought so remarkable
that one who heard it, unwilling that the
record of so much coolness and courage
should be lost, wrote it down for future generations
of boys to read.</p>

<h2><a name="V" id="V"></a>V<br />
THE CROWN OF AN AMERICAN QUEEN<br />
<i>In the Days of Bacon’s Rebellion in Virginia</i></h2>

<p>In the age when America was but
a name and Virginia only a hamlet,
there was a dusky queen who
wore a silver crown by order of
his most sacred Majesty King Charles II.,
King of England, Scotland, France, Ireland,
and Virginia.</p>

<p>There are few distinct Indian personalities.
Powhatan, Pocahontas, Opechancanough, Totopotomoi
and his wife, the Queen of the
Pamunkeys, are savage heroes who sentinel
the seventeenth century; they all belonged
to the Pamunkey tribe of the great Powhatan
Confederacy, the most powerful Indian
combination that ever existed.</p>

<p>When the boisterous and heroic Nathaniel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
Bacon<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> was in the flush of his wonderful success,
and had brought his followers to Jamestown,
he demanded of the Governor redress
for Indian depredations and outrages. When
the Assembly in council was sitting, the
Queen of the Pamunkeys came in, leading
her son by the hand. She came to tell of
grievances also. She wore a dress of black
and white wampum peake and a mantle of
deer-skin, “cut in a frenge” six inches from
the outer edge. It fell loosely from her
shoulders to her feet. On her head was a
crown of “purple bead of shell, drilled.”
She was a beautiful woman, old chronicles
tell us, and she walked in with a proud but
aggrieved countenance.</p>

<p>She sat down in the midst of the Assembly,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
listening eagerly to the arguments for the
suppression and, if need be, the extinction of
her race. And she remembered Totopotomoi
bleeding for these people who would not recognize
her rights. She arose and made a
speech in her own tongue, eloquent with
gesticulation; the refrain of it was a mad
wail: “Totopotomoi chepiak!” (<i>i.e.</i>, Totopotomoi
dead).</p>

<p>Colonel Hill, the younger, touched a fellow-member
on the shoulder, and whispered:
“What she says is true. Totopotomoi
fought with my father, and fell with his
warriors.”</p>

<p>But the Assembly would not listen to the
poor suffering Queen. They wanted to fight
more battles, and the Queen of the Pamunkeys
must furnish her quota.</p>

<p>“How many men will you furnish?” asked
Nathaniel Bacon. “How many will you
give to fight and subdue the treacherous
tribes which threaten our peace?”</p>

<p>The Queen was silent. She remembered
her husband and his slain braves. She had
fears for her son, and she would not speak.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
“How many?” asked Bacon.</p>

<p>The poor Queen had her head turned away
and bowed.</p>

<p>“How many?” demanded the famous rebel
again.</p>

<p>Then she slowly turned her lovely face,
and softly whispered, “Six.”</p>

<p>Her answer infuriated Bacon, who considered
the number contemptible. “How
many more?” he asked.</p>

<p>The Queen gave him a glance of indignant
hate, and haughtily answered, “Twelve.”
Then she gathered her robes about her, and
majestically left the room.</p>

<p>Once more we see the Queen of the Pamunkeys,
and now in fear and adversity.
Bacon in his campaign destroyed the Pamunkey
settlement&mdash;the same tribe which
had so nobly assisted the English.</p>

<p>The poor Queen, terrified, fled far into the
forest, accompanied by “onely a little Indian
boy.” Her old nurse followed her, but
was captured. Bacon ordered the old woman
to guide him to a certain point, but she, full
of revenge, led him in an opposite direction,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
whereupon the rebel ordered her to be knocked
in the head.</p>

<p>The Queen wandered about almost crazy,
and at last determined to return and throw
herself upon Bacon’s mercy; but as she was
rushing towards her desolated wigwam she
came upon the body of her murdered nurse,
which so affrighted her that she ran back
into the wilderness, where she remained
“fourteen daies without food, and would have
perished but that she gnawed on the legg of a
terrapin which the little Indian boy brought
her.”</p>

<p>So only a few vivid sketches of this Queen
are preserved to us in history but they have
gained for her a place as a martyr. In recognition
of her own and her husband’s deeds,
Charles II. bestowed upon her a silver crown,
with the lion of England, the lilies of France,
and the harp of Ireland engraved thereon.</p>

<p>Savages are not averse to the baubles of
civilization, and the crown which their Queen
wore was a blessed treasure to her tribe for a
hundred years after the Queen was dead.</p>

<p>The Pamunkey tribe, or a pitiful remnant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
of them, still dwell in Virginia, on the river
which bears their name. They have a chief,
and their own government. Annually they
send tribute of fish and game and Indian
handiwork to the Governor of Virginia. They
are weakening physically, and pray for new
blood from the Western reservation.</p>

<p>Once the tribe started for the West, carrying
their best treasure, the silver crown. They
came to the plantation of Mr. Morson, at
Falmouth, and there bad weather and sickness
made them halt. Mr. Morson attended
to their physical wants, and allowed them to
pitch their tents upon his land until their
distress abated.</p>

<p>“What do we owe you?” asked the chief,
when they had decided to return to their
former Virginia reservation.</p>

<p>“Nothing,” said Mr. Morson. Perhaps he
remembered Totopotomoi and his sorrowing
Queen.</p>

<p>“Then we will give you what we value
most,” and the chief presented to Mr. Morson
the crown of the Queen of the Pamunkeys.
For three generations it remained in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
Morson family, and then it was purchased
by the Association for the Preservation of
Virginia Antiquities.</p>

<p>The crown is really a frontlet, and the
Queen of the Pamunkeys wore it upon her
brow, surmounted by a red velvet cap, long
since destroyed by moths, and bound to her
head by two silver chains.</p>

HOW A BLACKSMITH’S BOY BECAME A KNIGHT<br />
<i>The Treasure-hunt of William Phipps in the
late Seventeenth Century</i></h2>

<p>Sir William Phipps, Baronet;
Captain in the Royal Navy; Captain-General
and Commander-in-Chief
of Massachusetts Bay; Governor
of Massachusetts.</p>

<p>What do you think of all these titles for
one man to wear? Surely, you say, he must
naturally have been a great man to deserve
so much distinction; and again you say
that the conditions of his life must account
for such honors; that he must have been of
gentle birth, reared in luxury, his education
carefully attended by excellent masters, and
great influence brought to bear upon his
King to advance him so far on the high-road<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
of fame. Well, let us see if facts will sustain
this thought.</p>

<p>William Phipps was born February 2, 1650,
in a wretched log house on the banks of the
Kennebec River. His father, an honest but
ignorant blacksmith, was more dependent
upon his rifle and fishing-line to supply
his family with food than upon the occasional
shilling that found its way into the
smoke-begrimed interior of his rude workshop.</p>

<p>Without education himself, the father was
unable to instruct his children beyond the
simplest rules of arithmetic and the plainest
spelling and reading, but these he drilled
them in as perseveringly as he did in the
terrifying religious catechism of that day.
In the course of years, when William developed
into a robust, courageous lad, he
shared with his parents the duties of providing
for his sisters and brothers by either
shouldering the heavy fire-arm and plunging
into the dark Maine forests in quest of game,
or in taking his father’s place and beating
out the iron sparks, while the sturdy smith<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
dropped a temptingly baited hook into the
swiftly flowing stream.</p>

<p>In the year 1676, in his twenty-seventh
year, the hero of our story received his parents’
blessing, and left home for the purpose
of seeking his fortune. With a hopeful heart
and an exceedingly light pocket, he made his
way to Boston, and found employment in the
blacksmith-shop of one Roger Spencer, whose
pretty daughter Charity soon won the heart
of her father’s handsome, stalwart helper.</p>

<p>So far we fail to find very much in the
way of gentle birth, luxury, education, and
influence. But then, you may ask, how, under
such circumstances, could he ever have
risen so high? Let us follow his career.</p>

<p>His lack of worldly goods was made the
excuse for refusing the offer of his heart and
hand that he made to the fair Puritan, and
in the hope of improving his fortunes he
forsook the forge and shipped on board of a
merchant vessel to follow the adventurous
life of a sailor. When saying farewell, he
gave his promise to return in a few years
with money enough to build a fair brick<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
house for his lady-love in one of the green
lanes of Boston.</p>

<p>The ship in which Phipps sailed carried a
cargo to the island of Jamaica, then cruised
between that port and England for several
voyages. Owing to his industry and ability
as a seaman, Phipps was after a time advanced
to the position of mate. A voyage
or two following his promotion he fell in with
an old seaman who claimed to be the only
survivor of a Spanish vessel containing immense
treasure that had been wrecked on
one of the coral islands in the West Indies
some years before. It appears that this
treasure-ship had sailed from the coast of
South America, freighted with a cargo of
silver which had been dug out of the mines
and cast into bricks to be conveyed to Spain.
The sailor assured Mr. Phipps that the exact
location of the wreck was known to him, and
agreed, for a certain share of the profits, to
conduct an expedition to the place where the
vessel had gone down. Believing the story to
be true, the mate bound the seaman to secrecy,
and gave him a berth on board his vessel.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
Upon arriving in London, application was
made by him to the King for permission and
aid to fit out a ship for the purpose of recovering
a great treasure that had been lost
by the sinking of a Spanish galleon in the
West Indies, claiming that he had accidentally
learned the location of the vessel, and
that he would guarantee to secure the precious
cargo. After considerable delay a ship
called the <i>Algier Rose</i> was placed under his
command, and with a crew of ninety men
he set sail. Upon reaching the West Indies
a mutiny broke out among the forecastle
hands, and Captain Phipps found it necessary
to put into Jamaica, discharge all hands, and
ship a new company. He now started for
the scene of the wreck, but a day or two
following the carpenter informed him that
he had overheard the sailors plot to capture
the vessel as soon as the treasure was recovered,
and use the craft thereafter as a
pirate. The Captain immediately decided
to return to England, where he arrived after
a stormy passage. Under the patronage
of the Duke of Albemarle the ship was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
refitted, and a trustworthy crew put on
board.</p>

<p>The second voyage across the Atlantic was
pleasant and speedy, but just after entering
the Caribbean Sea a new danger threatened
the adventurers, for early one morning they
encountered a large Spanish frigate, which
at once started in chase of them. Captain
Phipps addressed his crew, telling them that
if they permitted their ship to be captured
they would be sent into the interior of the
country as slaves, to drag out their lives in
the silver-mines. He bade them fight bravely
if they wished to enjoy home and freedom
ever again. The superior speed of the Spaniard
soon enabled that vessel to open fire on
the <i>Algier Rose</i>, which so heartily returned
the compliment that some of the foreigner’s
spars were shot away, making her fall astern
of her saucy enemy, who now succeeded in escaping.
Without further trouble the treasure-hunters
reached the island on whose treacherous
coral reefs the silver-ship had been wrecked.
Here the <i>Algier Rose</i> was safely moored,
and search commenced for the sunken wealth.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
The small boats were used to explore the
reefs, and served as platforms from which
the best swimmers in the crew would dive
into the channels between the walls of coral
on the lee side of the island, endeavoring to
locate the spot where the galleon had been
carried before she struck. As the water in
these places seldom exceeded twenty feet in
depth, the bottom would have been plainly
visible from the boat had it not been for the
continuous rippling and foaming of the surface
water. Several weeks were passed in a
vain pursuit, and at last, worn out and discouraged,
the men positively refused to continue
the work. By agreeing to abandon
the enterprise and set sail for England at the
end of another week, unless some success was
met with, the Captain prevailed upon several
of his seamen to aid him for that length of
time.</p>

<p>Day after day went by, and the seventh
and last day specified in the agreement arrived.
Two of the divers had broken down
under the strain, and now when the final trial
was to be made the Captain called for two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
men to go in their stead, but no one responded.
He then appealed to their manhood,
asked them if he had not shared all their
labors, and asked them to give him but one
day more. The dispirited sailors made no
response to the appeal, but the cook volunteered
to go if some one would take his place
in the galley. This man was a negro about
thirty years of age, and had been shipped in
England to act as a cabin servant on the
<i>Algier Rose</i>, but the ship’s cook having died
on the passage out, he had been sent into the
caboose to take the former’s place. Possessing
a powerful physique and being an excellent
swimmer, he stood by his Captain that
day, the sole remaining hope, and seemed
tireless in his efforts to find for the disheartened
commander some evidence of the treasure,
which the seamen swore existed only
in the capsized brain of the man whom they
could see out yonder under the broiling sun
guiding the boat in and out of the channels,
while the laughing, leaping waters tinkled
against the bows and ran in gurgling,
mocking glee along the side. The negro<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
would dive into the sea, and a few moments
later reappear; then, as he swam towards
the boat, he would shake his head in answer
to the anxious, questioning look in the
Captain’s eyes. The boat would move on
again a short distance, and while the rowers
held it stationary a dark form would part the
water and sink down and down among the
startled fishes, that flashed away in affright
from the strange creature whose darting
arms seemed to grasp at them as they shot
for safety among the branches of coral underbush.</p>

<p>The morning has passed gloomily away,
and the negro plunges over the side for the
last time before the men row back to the
ship for dinner. Suddenly a black face in
which is set two wildly rolling eyes bobs up
alongside the boat, and a voice choking for
breath and broken with excitement manages
to gasp, “Him down thar, Massa Cap’n; him
down thar!”</p>

<p>The great treasure is discovered!</p>

<p>No more despondency now. No more
aching limbs. Splash, splash, splash! The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
rowers have torn off their scanty clothing,
and jumped over the side to prove with their
own eyes the story brought up to them from
the bottom of the sea. One by one men reappear,
and their recovered breath is used
to send such a glad shout across the reefs
that their shipmates hear it over a mile away,
tumble into the boats alongside, and pull
madly out to them; then learning the joyful
news, they break into cheers, kick off their
garments, and overboard they also go to see
the ingots of silver scattered over the white
sand amid the torn and broken remnants of
the wreck.</p>

<p>During the two weeks that followed the
crew of the <i>Algier Rose</i> worked zealously at
recovering the wealth that the Spaniards had
taken such pains to garner from the mountain
range just back of the coast. A shallow
net-work bag was hitched together by the
seamen for the purpose of holding the bars
of silver that the divers would throw into it.
Those manning the float that had been constructed
would lower the rope cradle until it
rested on the bottom; then the diver would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
thrust his feet into a pair of heavy lead slippers
and drop through the hole in the centre
of the raft which was anchored above the
wreck. An instant later, when the bed of
sand was reached, the diver would quickly
select and throw a brick of metal into the
basket, drop his clumsy foot-gear into the
same receptacle, and then, relieved of the
weight which had held him down, he would
shoot up to the surface of the water. Accepting
his reappearance as a signal, the men
on the float would haul up the net, lift out
the treasure, and pass it into the small boats
to be carried to the ship. At the end of a
fortnight, when the divers reported that the
last bar had been gathered, the Captain calculated
that he had recovered fully thirty tons
of pure silver.</p>

<p>The stone in the lower hold was thrown
overboard to make room for the noble ballast,
which was carefully stowed and wedged
in its mean and gloomy quarters under the
decks. The <i>Algier Rose</i> now sailed for England,
where she arrived safely five weeks
from the day that her anchor had been hove<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
up from its resting-place on the white coral
bed off the treasure island.</p>

<p>Captain Phipps’s share of the profits was
very large, but the exact amount is unknown.
In addition to a princely revenue, the King
was so much pleased with him for bringing
such wealth into the country that he conferred
on him the honor of knighthood,
and to reward him still further for having
beaten off the Spanish man-of-war,
his Majesty was pleased to grant him
a commission as Captain in the Royal
Navy.</p>

<p>Sir William soon sailed for Boston in command
of a fine frigate, and a reunion with
the now-envied Charity was speedily followed
by the tying of a true-lover’s knot before the
altar of the old meeting-house near the fort.
A few months later the former blacksmith’s
boy redeemed his promise by presenting to
my lady “a fair brick house in one of the
green lanes of Boston.” This residence,
which was erected on Salem Street, stood
until a few years ago, being last used as an
orphan asylum for boys. In 1690 Sir William
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>was named by the King, Captain-General
and Commander-in-Chief of Massachusetts
Bay, and several years later received a royal
patent as Governor of Massachusetts.</p>

<h2><a name="VII" id="VII"></a>VII<br />
THE GIRL CAPTAIN OF CASTLE DANGEROUS<br />
<i>How Three Children Fought the Iroquois in 1692</i></h2>

<p>Among all the incidents of endurance
and pluck set forth in the
annals of the history of North
America, few can be found more
remarkable than that which is contained
in some very dusty pages to be read in
quaint French in a Paris library, or in the
transcription of them by one of our own historical
authors&mdash;the “Statement of Mademoiselle
Magdeleine de Verchères, aged Fourteen
Years,” daughter of the commander of a
lonely French fort, called after her father,
which stood on the St. Lawrence River a
score of miles below Montreal.</p>

<p>It was October 22, 1692. The strong
fort enclosure, stockade and block-house,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
were open, and the residents were at work
in their fields at some distance. M. de Verchères
was at Quebec on military business.
His wife (who was the heroine of another
famous incident of those perilous days) had
gone to Quebec. In the stockade were actually
only two soldiers, a couple of lads who
were the young girl’s brothers, one very aged
man, and a few women and children. Magdeleine&mdash;or,
as we should now spell it, Madeleine&mdash;was
standing at a considerable distance
from the open gate of the fort with a servant,
little suspecting any danger.</p>

<p>All at once a rattle of arms from the direction
where some of the agriculturists were
busy startled her. It was repeated. She
began to see men running in terror in the
far-away fields. At the same moment the
serving-man beside her, equally astonished,
exclaimed, “Run, Mademoiselle, run; the
Iroquois are upon us!” The young girl looked
where he pointed, and lo! a troop of some
forty or fifty of the wily savages, thinking to
surprise the stockade while their main band
attacked those who were outside, were running<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
towards the gates, scarcely a hundred
yards from where she stood trembling. There
was not an instant to lose. It was life or
death for her and all. She fled for the fort.
The rest of her story can largely be quoted
from Mademoiselle Madeleine’s own recitation,
published at the time.</p>

<p>“The Iroquois who chased me, seeing that
they could not catch me alive before I reached
the gate, stopped and fired at me. The
bullets whistled about my ears, and [as she
says, dryly] made the time seem very long.
As soon as I was near enough to be heard, I
cried out, ‘To arms! to arms!’ hoping that
somebody would come out and help me, but
it was no use. The two soldiers in the fort
were so terrified that they had hidden within
the block-house.</p>

<p>“At the gate I found two women crying
for their husbands, who had just been killed.
I forced them to go in and shut the gate. I
next thought what I could do to save myself
and the few people with me. I went to inspect
the fort, and found that several palisades
had fallen down and left openings by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
which the enemy could easily get in. I
ordered them to be set up again, and helped
to carry them myself.”</p>

<p>It may be asked how there was sufficient
time for this necessary work. But it must
be remembered that the Indians seldom came
directly to the stockade in daylight, dreading
concealed defenders greatly, and in the present
instance they were ignorant of the singularly
unprotected state of this fort. So
the brave little girl was able to prepare for
the worst with all her wonderful presence of
mind and courage. She continues:</p>

<p>“When all the breaches were stopped, I
went to the block-house, where the ammunition
is kept, and here I found the two soldiers,
one hiding in a corner, and the other with a
lighted match in his hand. ‘What are you
going to do with that match?’ I asked. He
answered, ‘Set off the powder and blow us
all up!’ ‘You are a miserable coward,’ said I.
‘Go out of this place!’ I spoke so resolutely
that he obeyed. I then threw off my bonnet,
and after putting on a hat and taking a gun
I said to my brothers: ‘Let us fight to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
death. We are fighting for our country and
our religion. Remember that our father has
taught you that gentlemen are born to shed
their blood for the service of God and the
King.’”</p>

<p>Getting her little company together in the
stockade, and discovering the Iroquois moving
about the fields, and either pursuing the
unfortunate men and women in them, or else
discussing the best means of advancing,
Madeleine began firing at them from various
loop-holes, and directed a cannon to be discharged
to deter them from coming nearer,
and at the same time to spread the alarm
over the vicinity. The women and children
shrieked and clamored. She made them be
silent, for fear of letting the redskins suspect
the situation. The foe drew back and remained
quiet for a time, and as they did this
a canoe with several persons in it was seen
out upon the river coming swiftly to the dock
near the fort. It was evident that those in
it did not suspect the danger that was so near,
whatever else they had heard. It was possible
to save them from slaughter, and at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
same time add the settler she recognized in
the canoe, with his family, to the little garrison.
Madeleine went out alone&mdash;none other
dared&mdash;from the stockade to the dock, and
received them.</p>

<p>The Indians, seeing only a little girl meet
the new arrivals, feared a grand sortie if they
dashed out of their ambush, and allowed
Madeleine to escort the new-comers&mdash;a settler
named Fontaine and his party&mdash;into the
fort gates unhurt. She had hoped for this,
and was overjoyed at her success. Her garrison
now numbered six. She goes on:</p>

<p>“Strengthened by this reinforcement, I
ordered that the enemy should be fired on
whenever they showed themselves. After
sunset a violent northeast wind began to
blow, accompanied by snow and hail, which
told us we should have a terrible night. The
Iroquois were all this time lurking about us,
and I judged by their movements that, instead
of being deterred by the storm, they
would climb into the fort under cover of the
darkness. I assembled all my troop (that is
to say, six persons), and spoke to them thus:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
‘God has saved us to-day from the hands of
our foes, but we must take care not to fall
into their snares to-night. As for me, I want
you to see that I am not afraid. I will take
charge of the fort, with the old man [she adds
that he was eighty, and had never fired a gun,
but he could probably carry an alarm]; and
you, Pierre Fontaine, with La Bonté and
Gachet, go to the block-house with the
women and children, because that is the
strongest place; and if I am taken, don’t
surrender, even if I am cut to pieces and
burned before your eyes. The enemy cannot
hurt you in the block-house, if you make
the least show of fight.’</p>

<p>“I placed my young brothers on two of
the bastions, the old man on the third, and
I took the fourth; and all night, in spite of
wind, snow, and hail, the cries of ‘All’s well!’
were kept up from the block-house to the
fort, and from the fort to the block-house.
One would have thought that the place was
full of soldiers. The Iroquois believed so,
and were completely deceived, as they confessed
afterwards to M. de Callières, to whom<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
they told that they had held a council to
make a plan for capturing the fort in the
night, but had done nothing because such a
constant watch was kept.</p>

<p>“About one o’clock in the morning the
sentinel [the old man] on the bastion by the
gate called out, ‘Mademoiselle, I hear something!’
I went to him to find out what it
was, and by the help of the snow which covered
the ground I could see in the darkness
a number of cattle, the miserable remnant
that the Iroquois had left us. The others
wanted to open the gate and let them in, but
I answered: ‘No. You don’t know all the
tricks of the savages. They are, no doubt,
following the cattle, covered with skins of
such animals, so as to get into the fort if we
are foolish enough to open the gate for them.’
Nevertheless, after taking every precaution,
I decided that we might open it without risk.</p>

<p>“At last the daylight came again, and as
the darkness disappeared our anxieties seemed
to disappear with it. Everybody took
courage excepting Madame Marguerite, wife
of the Sieur Fontaine, who, being extremely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
timid, as all Parisian women are, asked her
husband to carry her to another fort. [A
silly request, certainly.] He said, ‘I will
never abandon this fort while Mademoiselle
Madeleine is here.’ I answered him that I
would rather die than give it up to the
enemy, and that it was of the greatest importance
that they should never get possession
of any French fort, because if they took
<em>one</em> they would think they could get others,
and would grow more bold and presumptuous
than ever.</p>

<p>“I may say, with truth, that I did not eat
nor sleep for twice twenty-four hours. I did
not go once into my father’s house, but kept
always on the bastion, or went to the block-house
to see how the people there were behaving.
I always kept a cheerful and smiling
face, and encouraged my little company
with the hope of speedy succor.</p>

<p>“We were one week in constant alarm,
with the enemy always about us. At last
M. de la Monnerie, a lieutenant sent by M.
de Callières, arrived in the night with forty
men. [He came down the river.] As he did<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
not know whether the fort was taken or not,
he approached as silently as possible. One
of our sentinels, hearing a slight sound, cried,
‘Who goes there?’ I was at the time dozing,
with my head on a table and my gun lying
across my arms. The sentinel told me that
he heard a voice from the river. I went up
at once to the bastion to see whether it was
of Indians or Frenchmen. I demanded,
‘Who goes there?’ One of them replied,
‘We are Frenchmen; it is De la Monnerie,
come to bring you help.’ I caused the gate
to be opened, placed a sentinel there, and
went down to the river to meet them. As
soon as I saw M. de la Monnerie I saluted
him and said, ‘Monsieur, I resign my arms
to you.’ He answered, gallantly, ‘Mademoiselle,
they are in good hands.’ ‘Better
than you suppose,’ I returned. He inspected
the fort and found everything in order
and a sentinel on each bastion. ‘It is time
to relieve them, monsieur,’ said I; ‘we have
not been off our bastions for a week.’”</p>

<p>M. de la Monnerie in astonished admiration
took charge of the relieved fort. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
heroine’s work was over. The savages fled,
and not long after they were captured near
Lake Champlain, and some twenty persons
they had made prisoners at Verchères were
brought safely back. The father and mother
of Madeleine came from Montreal and Quebec,
and heard the story of her valor and coolness
with rapturous praise. She grew up to be a
woman, receiving for her life a pension from
the King of France as a mark of honor, and
she died at an advanced age.</p>

<h2><a name="VIII" id="VIII"></a>VIII<br />
HOW MARC WAS MADE CAPTAIN<br />
<i>A Rescue from the “Lords of the Woods” in 1695</i></h2>

<p>One evening in the winter of 1694-95
a dozen young men were lounging
around the fire in the big room
of the storehouse at St. Maxime, a
small settlement on the St. Lawrence River.
The door opened and two others entered,
brushing the snow from their leggings and
moccasins.</p>

<p>“What luck with your traps?” cried one
of the loungers.</p>

<p>“An otter and eight beaver,” answered
Noël Duroc, as he tossed a pack of pelts into
the corner. He was a tall, straight young
Frenchman, whose gay and careless nature
looked out frankly through a pair of laughing
black eyes. “But come, Madame Bouvier,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>”
he cried to the store-keeper’s wife, “give us
something to eat; hot, and plenty of it&mdash;eh,
Philippe! If you want news, there’s more
than news of traps&mdash;it’s of the Iroquois.
’Tis said they’re ready for a raid to the
north&mdash;to make glad the hearts of their good
friends the Algonquins and the French. So
our old bear of a seigneur may do some hugging.
But to-night he has other things to
think of. Marc is home&mdash;came up along the
river from Quebec to-day.”</p>

<p>“Is he as much of a monk as ’twas said he
would be?” asked Jean Bourdo. “You know
the old seigneur swears he will have no monk’s
scholar around him&mdash;though he were twice
his nephew.”</p>

<p>“We have just seen Marc, and, trust me, he
is the same jolly lad he was two years ago.
You can make no grave-faced monk of him!
But the old seigneur thinks him surely spoiled.
’Twere better Marc had not seen the
monastery&mdash;not that I lack as a churchman;
what would we do at St. Maxime were it not
for our good Father Auguste, who taught us
when we were boys, and keeps us straight<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
now that we are men?&mdash;for if he had stayed
here he would doubtless be our captain&mdash;a
post worth having, now that the Iroquois are
like to visit us.”</p>

<p>“Who will be our captain?” asked Jean
Bourdo.</p>

<p>“The seigneur has sent to Quebec for an
officer&mdash;one that’s lately from France, and
that’s been well trained in the King’s army.
The old man knows how much we sympathize
with Marc, and so, being surly as a
bear, he will have none of us.”</p>

<p>“It may be a costly mistake, this putting
of an Old-World soldier over us,” said Jean.
“’Tis true we have small knowledge of the
science of war as taught in old France; but
we can fight in the woods, and know how to
beat the Iroquois at their own game, and I’ll
warrant that’s more than this fine soldier
can do! ’Tis a pity that Marc&mdash;a lad brought
up in the woods, whom we all like and would
gladly follow&mdash;should be kept back just because
madame his mother sent him to school
to the monks. But the old seigneur will
have his way, even when ’tis to his harm!”</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
“So he will; and if Marc is to lead us, the
seigneur must be made to think that it is
his own doing. Come, Philippe,” continued
Noël, turning to the man who had come in
with him, “you are older than the rest, and
have a wiser head; think of some way of
bending the seigneur to our purpose.”</p>

<p>They talked till far into the night, and
when they separated the young Frenchmen
had the cheerful and impatient air of men
(or boys, for so they would now be counted)
who had planned an undertaking and were
in a hurry to carry it out.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>In the afternoon of the next day old
Antoine de la Carre, seigneur of the score of
log-houses and the vast tract of woodland
belonging to the royal settlement of St.
Maxime, marshalled his fighting force. In
front of the storehouse was an open space,
from which the snow was kept clear, and
here the soldiers of St. Maxime were drawn
up in line. There were about forty of them
all told, half of their number being young
men, voyageurs, and <i>coureurs des bois</i>; the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
others were older, heads of families who
devoted themselves to the more peaceful occupations
of fishing and farming.</p>

<p>“I have news,” said Antoine de la Carre,
“that the Iroquois are moving, so it behooves
us to make ready for them. You
older men shall act as a reserve; the younger
ones I will organize into a company always
to be under arms and ready to repel attack.
Noël Duroc, I appoint you lieutenant, to
have charge till the officer who is to be your
captain comes from Quebec. Be active in
your duty, and see that you leave nothing
undone that is for the good of the settlement.”</p>

<p>“We’ll do what we think is best for the
settlement, and he’ll find us active enough&mdash;that’s
certain!” whispered Jean Bourdo,
nudging his neighbor.</p>

<p>In the ranks of the younger men was a
tall, dark-haired lad who had the same bold
features that belonged to the old seigneur.
All observed him, for it was Marc Larocque’s
first appearance after his two years’ stay in
Quebec. He met his uncle’s sour looks with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
unflinching, smiling eyes, and the settlers
whispered among themselves that the old
seigneur would find it no easy matter to
ignore his nephew&mdash;he had the De la Carre
spirit, in spite of the monks and their book-learning.</p>

<p>That evening was a gloomy one in the
house of Antoine de la Carre. The old man
sat in silence, drinking deep draughts of red
French wine; across the room was his sister,
the widow Larocque, teaching their catechism
to two little maids. He knew she
thought him unfair to her son, who, by right
of birth and his own qualities, had reason to
expect a place of authority at St. Maxime,
and this knowledge made the old seigneur
more than usually irritable. When the children
had finished reading their tasks and left
the room he broke out:</p>

<p>“Ha, Madeleine, you look so solemn, doubtless,
because of your dear Marc! Well, why
did you send him to the monks to have a
scholar made out of him? You know how
I despise these long-faced readers of musty
books, yet you must thwart me in this way.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
I’ll not forgive you nor him. I had no fault
to find in the old days&mdash;then he was a good
lad enough, and a true De la Carre. But I
tell you now, as I told you two years ago
when you talked of sending him to Quebec,
that I’ll have no bookman for a nephew.
So you’ve only yourself to blame if he be set
aside. But you were always obstinate.”</p>

<p>“Ah, almost as obstinate as you, Antoine.
But I’ll not trouble about Marc; if you’ll not
help him, there are others that will. In these
stirring times a boy like him is not forgotten.”</p>

<p>After a pause he burst out again: “What
folly it was! Has a lad here, in our rugged
New France, any need of court manners and
monk’s learning? If you had sent him to
learn war it would have been different. But
to a monastery! When a boy in old France,
I was made to read Latin and dig into musty
manuscripts till they nearly made a philosopher
of me. But I had the good sense to
turn soldier, and since then I’ve had no liking
for monks and their learning. Madeleine,
you knew all this, and remember now&mdash;”</p>

<p>He was interrupted by a crash. The door<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
was burst open and half a dozen Indians
sprang into the room. Before Antoine could
draw his dagger they had leaped upon him,
seized his arms, and smothered his shouts.
Madame Larocque was quickly and securely
bound hand and foot and gagged.</p>

<p>The Iroquois&mdash;for by their paint and dress
the old man thought his captors to belong
to the dreaded tribes of the Five Nations&mdash;worked
noiselessly and swiftly; in less than
five minutes from the bursting in of the door
they led out Antoine de la Carre, his hands
tied behind his back, and a piece of leather
so fastened over his mouth that he could
make no sound. The guards that should
have been watching were nowhere to be seen,
and the Indians, with their prisoner, quickly
scaled the stockade, crept across a cleared
space to the woods, hurried to the river, and
were soon on the smooth, wind-swept ice and
moving rapidly westward. “Where were
those young rascals of my company when I
needed them?&mdash;drinking in the storehouse
or dancing in one of the cabins, most like!”
growled old Antoine to himself.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
He was as strong as an old bear, but his
joints were stiffened with age, and he had
difficulty in keeping up with the rapid pace
of the Indians. “What sinews these Iroquois
have!” he thought, as he struggled on.
“No Algonquin could hold his own with
them; they run as well as our own young
<i>coureurs des bois</i>!”</p>

<p>When it became evident that he could go
no farther, they stopped their journey along
the ice and, turning into the forest, went
about a quarter of a mile from the river’s
bank. Here they found a dense evergreen
thicket and prepared to make their camp.
A fire was built, and some strips of dried
meat they carried were heated and eaten;
then they stretched themselves on evergreen
boughs which had been piled on the snow
near the fire. A tall young Indian, who
seemed to be the leader of the little band,
now turned to Antoine de la Carre and,
much to his surprise, spoke to him in French.</p>

<p>“Old man, eat and warm yourself. We
have far to go, and you are not yet to die.”</p>

<p>Antoine obeyed, and after he had managed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
to swallow some of the tough meat he felt
better. “How do you, that are of the Iroquois,
who trade with the English and Dutch,
come to speak French?” he asked of the
young Indian.</p>

<p>“A French girl was brought a captive to
our tribe; my father, who was a great warrior,
took her for his squaw, and she was my
mother. She taught me the language of the
French, and taught me also to listen to the
words of the black-robed Jesuits who used
to come south to teach the Iroquois. My
mother loved my father, and bade me fight
the enemies of his people, and so I am here.
But I wish the Jesuit teachers would come
among the Iroquois as they used to do. I
liked to hear them talk in that strange tongue
they called the Latin.”</p>

<p>“Did you?” said Antoine, glad to make
friends with the young Iroquois. “When
young I was taught by the monks, and know
some Latin.”</p>

<p>“That is well,” returned the Indian, with
much satisfaction. “I too was a pupil of the
monks, and always listened to them gladly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
Stand up and repeat to us some of the Latin
you learned. When the good Jesuit would
talk in that tongue to my mother and to me,
the words came like music, and then he would
tell us the meaning&mdash;it told of adventures
and battles and great warriors. Repeat to
us this musical tongue.”</p>

<p>Antoine de la Carre would rather have
fought a bull moose single-handed; but here
was no choice, and he stood up and did his
best. That was not very well; for his voice
was as hoarse as a swamp-raven’s, and it
was many years since he had looked in a
book.</p>

<p>The Iroquois lying around on the evergreen
boughs were greatly amused at his
efforts, laughing at his hoarse voice and at
his stammering over the Latin words.</p>

<p>“You do not do it as well as did the
Jesuit,” exclaimed the half-breed. “Be careful,
Frenchman! Remember, I am no dull log
of a Montagnais&mdash;I am an Iroquois, a lord of
the woods, and will have no trifling!”</p>

<p>Antoine stammered on, getting more angry
each moment; for to a proud old soldier like<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
him nothing was worse than appearing ridiculous.
But this was a matter of life and
death, and he suppressed his feelings. “’Tis
well my young scamps of <i>coureurs des bois</i>
cannot see me now,” he thought. “They’d
never stop laughing!”</p>

<p>“Look more cheerful, Frenchman!” said
the tall half-breed, getting to his feet.
“What if you are to die to-morrow; surely
death has no terrors for so great a scholar
and philosopher! And come, when you are
talking to warriors of the Iroquois take off
your cap!” Antoine wore his black velvet
house-cap, and as the Iroquois spoke he
stepped forward and plucked it from the old
man’s head.</p>

<p>Antoine had been able to keep down his
anger at their laughing, but this was too
much for his small stock of patience, which
already was sorely tried. He was desperate
and reckless, for death was fairly certain
under any circumstances, and it might as
well come to-night as later.</p>

<p>“Insolent&mdash;take that!” he exclaimed, and
he struck out savagely.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
The tall half-breed, hit squarely between
the eyes, went down as if before the blow of
a sledge-hammer.</p>

<p>Several of the Indians sprang to their feet
and seized the old man. The half-breed got
up slowly, half stunned. Antoine waited for
his tomahawk to strike the death-blow, but
the half-breed did not raise his arm to strike.
“Old man,” he said, “if I were like these
other braves you would even now be dead;
but, as I told you, I am a convert, and the
Jesuit teaches that one must not be too quick
in anger&mdash;especially with the old and foolish.
You shall live, at least till to-morrow; give
thanks that I, like yourself, am a monk-taught
man!”</p>

<p>Soon afterwards the Iroquois arranged
themselves to sleep, one of their number
being left as a sentinel and guard over their
prisoner. Antoine’s hands and ankles were
bound, and by the half-breed’s orders he
was laid on the boughs near the fire. One
by one the Indians, save the guard, fell
asleep; but the old Frenchman was too
nervous and excited. Finally his attention<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
was arrested by an object that was slowly
and noiselessly stealing out from the evergreen
thicket. It crept straight towards the
Indian sentinel, who lay gazing up at the
stars that shone through the tree-tops. Of
a sudden there was a quick, stealthy movement
and the gleam of a knife: the sentinel’s
head sank back, and he lay stretched out,
still and motionless.</p>

<p>“A skilful thrust!” thought Antoine. “I
never saw a man die so easily.”</p>

<p>The man with the knife crept towards him,
and in a moment Antoine felt that the
thongs about his ankles and wrists were cut.
The man beckoned and stole away; Antoine
followed, and then they silently made their
way into the thicket&mdash;leaving the Indians
sleeping in the white starlight, the sentinel
looking most peaceful of all.</p>

<p class="caption">THE THONGS WERE CUT</p>
</div>

<p>“Do you know me, my uncle?” whispered
Marc Larocque. “I tracked you through the
snow. Follow me swiftly and quietly.”</p>

<p>Back they hurried to the river, and then
began the journey over the ice down to St.
Maxime.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
“I thought the Iroquois strong and fleet,
Marc, but I see that none of them is a match
for you! You are a brave fellow, in spite of
the monks, and never shall I forget what you
have done this night. But I wish you had
thrust your knife into the heart of the leader
of the Iroquois, an insolent fellow who pulled
my cap from my head and laughed at me.
However, I gave him a good buffet between
the eyes!”</p>

<p>Soon the old man began to lag behind, and
Marc had to grasp his arm to help him; so
they ran on through the white winter’s night.
With ghostly wings the great snowy owl
flapped across their path, and the wolf pack
halted for a moment to watch them pass,
and then turned away to hunt again for some
stray deer or wounded moose.</p>

<p>It was almost dawn when they reached the
stockade at St. Maxime. Old Antoine was
exhausted, and had hardly strength enough
to say to Marc: “Send a messenger to Quebec
to tell the French officer he need not come.
I have found a captain here.”</p>

<p>Marc took him to the seigneury, and he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
fell into a heavy sleep, from which he did
not wake till afternoon. The soldiers were
then at their daily drill, and after he had
eaten, the old man went out where they were.
Tall Lieutenant Noël Duroc was drilling
them. Antoine de la Carre gave them all a
severe scolding for their carelessness the night
before.</p>

<p>“If it were not for my brave nephew,” he
said, “I would surely have been murdered by
the Iroquois. Marc, step out from the ranks.
I make you captain!”</p>

<p>A shout went up from all the men, but old
Antoine silenced it with a gesture. He was
looking at Noël Duroc. “Lieutenant, your
face is black and blue; how were you hurt?
You were not so yesterday!”</p>

<p>“Last night, seigneur, an old bear gave
me a buffet&mdash;and a good round blow it
was!”</p>

<p>Antoine looked at him hard. “Lieutenant,
you had best let old bears alone!” Then he
turned quickly to his nephew. “Marc, has
that messenger yet started for Quebec who
was to stop the French officer?”</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
“He left soon after daybreak this morning.”</p>

<p>“Ah! you were not slow in sending him.”
The old man paused, and Noël, who was
watching him closely, thought he saw his
mouth twitch under the gray beard. “But
never mind; it may be for the best. You
shall be captain, my nephew, and you, Noël
Duroc, shall be lieutenant, though I think
you both rascals. However, no bookman
could run as Marc did this morning; and so
I know he is not wholly spoiled by the
monks.”</p>

<p>“Bravo!” cried Noël Duroc, throwing up
his cap. “Bravo! Here is a right good
seigneur who knows what is best for his
people; and a kind uncle; and&mdash;I’ll pledge
my word&mdash;a great scholar and philosopher
too!”</p>

<h2><a name="IX" id="IX"></a>IX<br />
CAPTAIN KIDD<br />
<i>An Overrated Pirate</i></h2>

<p>Of all the pirates whose dreaded
top-sails appeared along the coast
of America in the old days of the
colonies none has left a more
grewsome and romantic reputation behind
him than Captain William Kidd, the New
York ship-master, who was born in 1650.
Legends abound of his boldness, his craftiness,
and his savage and blood-thirsty disposition,
and stories of the immense treasure
that he accumulated, the dreadful murders
that he committed in its acquisition, and
when and with what ghastly accompaniments
he buried it are still told over the firesides
of ’longshore hamlets from Maine to the
Carolinas.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
Fiction has not neglected to turn this
pirate’s career to its own purpose, and one
of Poe’s most imaginative and thrilling tales
is based upon the discovery on Sullivan’s
Island, in Charleston Harbor (South Carolina),
of a parchment which, on being held
to the fire, revealed a cryptogram of Kidd’s
that led to the discovery of buried wealth
amounting to millions of dollars.</p>

<p>It seems almost a pity to tamper with the
halo of romance and mystery which posterity
has drawn about this worthy’s brow,
but the fact is that Kidd was an unready,
unwise, and vacillating character, and that
there was little truth in the romances told
about him. Beside such dreadfully famous
buccaneers as Blackbeard, Roberts, and
Avery he appears a pygmy in his own “profession,”
and his career, when contrasted
with theirs, seems colorless and contemptible.</p>

<p>As to the vast riches that he was supposed
to have acquired, it is doubtful if in his whole
course of piracy he was able to accumulate
more than a hundred thousand dollars. One
thing is assured&mdash;the only money that he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
buried on the coast of America amounted to
not more than seventy-five thousand dollars,
which he hid on Gardiner’s Island, over
against New London, and the last penny of
this was recovered by Bellamont after Kidd’s
execution.</p>

<p>During King William’s War Kidd, who was
a handsome man of somewhat pleasing address,
made the acquaintance of Lord Bellamont,
the Governor of Barbadoes. The two
were in New York at the time of the meeting,
and as Kidd was a member of a good family
and moved in the limited aristocratic circle
of that day, the new acquaintances saw much
of each other. Kidd’s plausible tongue, fund
of anecdote, and agreeable manner impressed
the Governor so pleasantly that his liking
for the shipman developed into esteem, and
esteem into friendship. Through Bellamont’s
influence Kidd obtained command of a privateer,
and a series of lucky events contributed
to his reputation, so that when he returned
to New York, after his cruise in the Gulf,
Bellamont and his other fine friends hailed
him with adulation as a conquering hero.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
He was wined and fêted, was toasted by
prominent men and noble dames, and over
many a steaming bowl and long-stemmed
pipe loosed his glib speech in a way to impress
his hearers with a fine notion of his
indomitable character. Through the thick
clouds of the Virginia tobacco smoke a great
idea was born in Bellamont’s hazy brain.
Complaints were made daily of the pirates
that infested the shores of the colonies.
These pirates were rich with plunder. True,
they were skilful and bold and crafty, but
here was a man who by his own confession
was more skilful and bolder and craftier
than any of them. Then, should Kidd be
fitted out with a fine ship and a good crew
to chase these pirates and capture them, great
glory would come to Bellamont’s name, and
great good to Bellamont’s pocket.</p>

<p>The idea was acted upon, and the Governor
and some other wealthy gentlemen purchased
the <i>Adventure</i> galley, equipped her, and armed
her with thirty carronades, while Kidd
went down among the docks and the sailors’
lodging-houses, picking out for his crew<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
sturdy two-handed mariners, men long of
the sea, blowzed by the weather, browned
by the wind, used to the pike and cutlass&mdash;men
like ducks on the shore and like monkeys
in the rigging.</p>

<p>The ship was fitted out at Plymouth, and
the great day of the sailing arrived at last.
The <i>Adventure</i> pushed out into the stream,
Kidd smirking and bowing and striking attitudes
on the quarter-deck, the busy sailors
swarming aloft to loose sail, the good ship
heeling over farther and farther as canvas
after canvas was spread to a quartering
breeze, and an assemblage of fine ladies and
gorgeous beaux waving scarfs and fluttering
handkerchiefs from the end of the pier.</p>

<p>Armed with a commission from King William
to apprehend the noted Captains “Thomas
Tew, John Ireland, Thomas Wake, and
William Maze, or Mace, and other subjects,
natives or inhabitants of New York and elsewhere
in our plantations in America, who
have associated with others, wicked and ill-disposed
persons, and do, against the laws of
nations, commit many and great piracies,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
robberies, and depredations on the seas, upon
the parts of America and in other parts, to
the great danger of our loving subjects, our
allies, and all others navigating the seas upon
their lawful occasions,” he steered from New
York on his way to the Guinea coast, where
his hunt was to begin. By the terms of his
commission he was to take the aforenamed
pirates by force if necessary, with all the
pirates, freebooters, and rovers associated
with them, wherever they were found. He
was to bring them into port, with all such
merchandise, money, goods, and wares as
should be discovered on board. But he was
strictly charged and commanded, “As you
will answer the contrary at your peril, that
you do not in any manner offend or molest
our friends or allies, their ships or subjects,
by whom or pretence of these presents or
the authority thereby granted.”</p>

<p>Kidd had another commission, called Letters
of Marque and Reprisal, to empower him
to act against the French, with whom the
English and their colonies were then at war,
and under cover of these he captured a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
French merchantman off Fire Island on his
way westward.</p>

<p>Upon arriving at New York he began to
request more assistance from his owners,
complained of the size of his ship and his
few guns, and, as he “proposed to deal with
a desperate enemy,” asked permission to increase
his complement. This was granted,
after some hesitation, and he finally sailed
from New York with a ship’s company of
one hundred and fifty-five men.</p>

<p>He made first for Madeira, thence to one
of the Cape Verde Islands, and thence to St.
Jago, in order to lay in salt provisions and
other necessaries. He then rounded the
Cape and bent his course towards Madagascar,
whose waters were the known rendezvous of
swarms of pirates. On the way he fell in
with three English men-of-war, to whose
commodore he imparted his errand with
much pomp and circumstance. He dined
aboard the flag-ship, and left behind him
the same reputation for dare-devil recklessness
and determination that his valiant
speech had obtained for him elsewhere.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
He parted with these ships after a few
days, and arrived at Madagascar in February,
1697, after a voyage of nine months.</p>

<p>At this time most of the pirate ships were
out in search of prey, so, having spent some
time in watering his ship and taking aboard
provisions, Kidd tried the coast of Malabar,
where he was equally unsuccessful in finding
his quarry. He touched at Mohila and at
Johanna, both famous resorts for pirates, but
he did not succeed even in getting news of
those whom he sought. The reason seemed
obvious&mdash;the pirate of those days was a dangerous
man to tackle. He had guns, and he
knew how to use them; he fought with a
halter round his neck, and was game to the
last gasp. He was in the habit of beating
the King’s ships sent to take him, and he
had a bending plank through the lee gangway
for their captured officers. A fat, rich
merchantman was an easier victim. Why
not sound the crew to see if they would agree
to a change of policy?</p>

<p>Some such thoughts must have been passing
through Kidd’s mind at this time, for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
with the gift of a brass farthing he could
have purchased from the most guileless and
affectionate native of Mohila or Johanna his
entire confidence as to the whereabouts of
his friends the sea-rovers, and yet after a
cruise of many months in this infested neighborhood
Kidd had no tidings of a single pirate
craft.</p>

<p>But however disposed towards acts of
violence, he had not yet the courage to put
his wishes into execution. On his second
voyage past the island of Mohila he passed
several Indian ships, richly laden and too
weak to offer him resistance, but he contented
himself with casting envious eyes upon
them and suffered them to go.</p>

<p>The first outrage that he committed was
at Mabbee, in the Red Sea, where, after
careening his ship, he took some corn from
the natives by force. After this he sailed
to Babs Key, near the Strait of Bab-el-Mandeb,
where he first began to open himself
to the ship’s company, and to disclose
to them his change of policy. But instead
of coming out like a man and saying that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
he intended to turn to piracy, he hinted and
insinuated and beat about the bush. “Unlucky
have we been hitherto; but courage,
my lads, we’ll make our fortunes out of the
Mocha fleet.” This was the closest his
pygmy heart could come to broaching the
subject that occupied his mind. But his
mariners met him more than half-way, and
he found himself committed to buccaneering
before he knew it. By the advice of his
quartermaster (the first mate or executive
officer of those days) he sent a boat to go
upon the coast and make discoveries, while
he himself kept men in the tops of the <i>Adventure</i>
to look out for the Mocha fleet.</p>

<p>The boat returned in a few days, bringing
word that fifteen or a score of ships were
about ready to sail, and that they were well
laden and rich.</p>

<p>Four days after this the fleet appeared;
the eager lookouts reported them, and the
men rushed to the sheets and halyards, guns
and ammunition-lockers.</p>

<p>Now was Kidd’s opportunity to dash in,
seize a valuable prize, and get off with her;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
but he hung off and on, perplexed between
timidity and cupidity, until by the time he
had made up his mind to put his fortune to
the touch his prey became alarmed and
began to scatter. He then bore down on
the nearest; but by this time he had been
sighted by the two men-of-war of the convoy,
and the sight of their black hulls speeding
towards him, straight and steady and
business-like through the flying merchantmen,
was enough for Kidd. He fired a feeble
shot or two, squared his yards, and made
off before the wind for dear life, while the
crew silently handled their tackle, and indulged
in I know not what contemptuous
thoughts of their commander.</p>

<p>But by the act of firing upon a friendly
flag Kidd had determined his status; there
was nothing for him now but to go on with
his pirating. Soon he had an opportunity
to show that desperate courage of which, by
his own account, he was possessed. Off the
coast of Malabar he met a small Moorish
coasting-vessel. Having discovered that she
was short-handed and unarmed, he became<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
terrible indeed. He seized her and forced
her Captain and quartermaster to take on
with him as pilot and interpreter, the Captain
being an Englishman, and the other, Don
Antonio, a Portuguese. The men he used
cruelly, hoisting them up by the arms, drubbing
them with a bare cutlass, and putting
them to other tortures to force them to disclose
the whereabouts of their treasure; but
all he got from them was a parcel of coffee
and a bale of pepper.</p>

<p>He then touched at Malabar, but finding
himself an object of suspicion he quickly
went away.</p>

<p>The coast was alarmed by this time, however,
and a Portuguese man-of-war was sent
out after him. Kidd fought her for a while
in a half-hearted way, but, though she was
his inferior in men and metal, he soon had
enough of honest combat, and got off by his
superior speed.</p>

<p>He next ran down to Porca, where he took
on board a number of hogs and other livestock
for provisions, and paid for them in
good British silver. He also watered his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
ship and otherwise provided for his ship’s
company.</p>

<p>He then stood to sea again, and came up
with a Moorish craft, the master of which,
a Dutchman named Schipper Mitchell, hoisted
French colors, as Kidd chased under that
flag. The pirates hailed in French, and were
answered in the same tongue by a Frenchman
who was one of Mitchell’s passengers. Kidd
then ordered the Dutchman to send a boat
on board, and when it arrived at his gangway
he asked the Frenchman if he had a
pass for himself. The passenger replied that
he had, whereupon Kidd told him to pass
for the Captain, “For, by Heaven, you are
the Captain, and if you say you’re not I’ll
hang you!”</p>

<p>The Frenchman of course dared not refuse
to do as he was ordered.</p>

<p>The object of the manœuvre is apparent.
Kidd had not the pluck to go on openly with
his high-sea robbery, but fancied that if he
seized the ship as a prize, pretending that
she belonged to French subjects, he would
get into no trouble on account of her. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
did not seem to take into account the fact
that his previous conduct had already stamped
him as a criminal, but appeared to think
that as long as he did not openly hoist the
black flag he might do as he liked with impunity.
Indeed, his whole career as a sea-robber
consisted of similar acts of fatuous
and ostrich-like stupidity.</p>

<p>He landed on one of the Malabar islands
for wood and water, and as his cooper was
murdered by the natives he plundered and
burned their village. He took one of the
islanders and had him tied to a tree and shot,
after which he again put to sea in quest of
prizes. After being at sea less than a week
he fell in with and captured the greatest
prize that ever fell into his hands, the Moorish
bark <i>Quedah Merchant</i>, of four hundred tons.
From this vessel he got a cargo which he sold
for more than ten thousand pounds.</p>

<img src="images/illus-108.jpg" width="500" height="316" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption">HE PLUNDERED AND BURNED</p>
</div>

<p>The Indians came on board of him and
trafficked, and he performed his bargains
punctually for a time, until he was ready to
sail; and then he took their goods and set
them on shore with no payment, which was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
quite in accord with his despicable character.
The Indians had been accustomed to deal
with pirates, and had found them, as a rule,
men of honor in the way of trade, so it was
easy for Kidd to impose upon them.</p>

<p>The pirate put some men aboard of the
<i>Quedah Merchant</i>, and in her company sailed
for Madagascar. He had no sooner arrived
there than off came a canoe in which were
several old acquaintances of his who had
long been “upon the account,” as they called
buccaneering. They belonged to a ship called
the <i>Resolution</i>, which was commanded by
one Culliford, a notorious sea-robber. When
they met Kidd they told him that they were
informed he had come to hang them, which
they would take very unkind in such an old
friend. Kidd dissipated their fears by telling
them that he was in every respect their
brother, and as bad as they, and in token of
amity drank their health in a bowl of grog.</p>

<p>Kidd then went aboard, Culliford promising
his friendship and assistance; and Culliford
in turn boarded Kidd, and the two
worthies made a merry night of it in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
cabin of the <i>Adventure</i>, spinning their yarns
of the deep seas and laughing at their enemies;
and as Culliford was in need of some necessaries,
Kidd fitted him out from his spare
tackle.</p>

<p>The <i>Adventure</i> was now so leaky that Kidd
transferred her guns and stores to the <i>Quedah
Merchant</i> and got to sea again, but not before
more than half of his disgusted crew had left
him.</p>

<p>He touched at Amboyan, and there learned
that the news of his conduct had reached
England and that he was outlawed. Indeed,
the reports of his misdeeds were so exaggerated
that the English merchants became
greatly alarmed, and had Kidd, with one
Captain Avery, excepted in a general pardon
of freebooters which had just been promulgated.
Kidd knew nothing of this, but relying
on some French passes which he had
found on one or two of his prizes, and deeming
his brazen assurance enough to carry him
through any peril from the law, he made for
New York. Here, by the orders of Lord
Bellamont, he was promptly seized, with all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
of his effects, and was sent to England to be
tried.</p>

<p>Here his conduct was such as to destroy
the last shreds of respect that one might have
had for his character. Instead of meeting
his fate like a man, he begged and implored
and whined and promised, but all to no
avail.</p>

<p>He insisted much upon his own innocence
and the villainy of his men. He went out
upon a laudable employment, he said, and
had no occasion to go pirating, but the men
mutinied against him and did as they pleased.
As to the friendship shown to that notorious
villain Culliford, Kidd denied it, and said
that he would have taken him, but his own
men, being a parcel of rogues, refused to
stand by him, and several of them even ran
from his ship to join the wicked pirate.</p>

<p>But the evidence was too strong against
him, and he was condemned.</p>

<p>When asked what he had to say why sentence
should not be pronounced upon him,
he replied that he had nothing to say except
that he had been sworn against by wicked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
people; and when sentence was pronounced
he said: “My lord, it is a very hard sentence.
For my part, I am the most innocent person
of them all, only I have been sworn against
by perjured persons.”</p>

<p>And so, in 1701, whining and protesting
miserably, he was led away to the scaffold,
and there paid the penalty of his crimes.</p>

<h2><a name="X" id="X"></a>X<br />
HOWARD THE BUCCANEER<br />
<i>A Captain of Many Ships</i></h2>

<p>In the days when high-sterned galleons
sailed the Spanish Main,
keelless and lofty, and helpless in
the wind’s eye; when all the sailors
wore their tarry queues and ear-rings;
when “Down along the coast of the high
Barbaree” there was no law but that of
the Moorish buccaneer, a young man in the
peaceful British hamlet of Barwich reached
the age of twenty-one.</p>

<p>Thomas Howard was a youth of promise
and capacity. He was handsome, burly,
popular, and generous, and always ready for
any adventure. His father, a gentleman of
rank and estate, was dead, but his doting
mother lavished upon him an affection as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
blind as it was deep, supplied him with an
excess of pocket-money, and left no wish of
his ungratified. The result is readily imagined.
His old amiability deserted him, and
he sank into a savage discontent that found
expression in numerous acts of roguery and
violence.</p>

<p>As he grew worse and worse, an old friend
of his father’s persuaded him to seek employment
upon the seas, and purchased him a
berth as midshipman on a trading-craft bound
from Liverpool to the West Indies.</p>

<p>A few months of sea discipline shattered
young Howard’s patience, and upon his arrival
at Jamaica he promptly deserted his
ship.</p>

<p>He had still a few pounds left of his fortune,
and with these he purchased admittance
to the society of a gang of ruffians who
frequented the beaches. One night, with
some of these, he stole a canoe and went to
the Grand Camanas to join a party of others
of their ilk who lurked thereabouts with the
design of going “on the account.”</p>

<p>They soon fell in with those whom they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
sought, and, as the party now numbered
twenty, they deemed themselves strong
enough to set to their work, and accordingly
began their preparations. At a council held
the night when this decision was reached,
the question of the election of officers came
up; the men seemed about evenly divided
in their choice of a captain between Howard
and a tall islander named James. The latter
was finally elected by a vote of ten to eight,
while Howard was chosen quartermaster.</p>

<p>Their first need was a boat; in the offing
at anchor lay a turtle-sloop with two small
swivels mounted fore and aft. She was the
very craft for their purpose, but how were
they to get her?</p>

<p>Close inshore on the other side of an estuary
a mile wide Howard remembered seeing
a large canoe moored in the light of a patrol’s
camp-fire. He and two others swam over to
her, cut her line with their sheath-knives, and
brought her away without discovery.</p>

<p>The robbers then boarded her, and, with
two men forward and two aft handling the
paddles, the rest concealed behind the high<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
bulwarks, stole out silently towards the
turtle-vessel. The nature of their craft was
not perceived until they were alongside their
victim, when, with a yell, they burst from
their concealment and made their capture
without losing a man. They then started
out for booty, but for a long time their only
prizes were turtlers, which supplied them
with men without increasing their wealth.
After about two weeks they met an Irish
brigantine with provisions and servants for
the Governor of Jamaica. They laid her
aboard, captured her without resistance,
forced her men, and made off with her, leaving
her master the old turtle-sloop and five
men to bring him to port. Not long after
this they surprised a sloop of six guns, and
finding her larger, faster, and sounder than
the brigantine, they shifted to her with their
belongings. This was the third time within
two months that they had changed their
vessel, but still the game of “Progressive
Piracy” went on. Off the coast of Virginia
they fell in with a large New England brigantine
laden with provisions and bound for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
Barbadoes. They made a prize of her, and
shifting their own guns aboard of her, found
themselves in a fine vessel of ten guns well
equipped for a long voyage.</p>

<p>While on the coast of Virginia in this ship
they took several English vessels, from which
they got men, arms, provisions, clothes, and
other necessaries. As most of these ships
had on board felons for the Virginia colonies,
they took from them a number of volunteers
besides their forced men, and they soon
acquired so large a complement that they
had no hesitation in ranging up to and
boarding a Virginia galley of superior size
and twenty-four guns. They got a number
of convict volunteers from her, transferred
their stores to her, and set out to sweep the
seas in earnest. They steered for the Guinea
coast, that Mecca of pirates, and made many
captures, which not only enriched them but
increased their complement. After they had
been for some months on this ground they
spied a large Portuguese ship from Brazil,
whose thirty-six guns did not frighten them
from the attack.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
As they hoisted the black flag the Brazilian
Captain became overpowered with fear, commanded
the quartermaster to strike, and
sought safety for himself in the hold. His
mate, however, a New-Englander, refused to
surrender, and kept off the pirates for the
better part of the afternoon. His resistance
was strong and well sustained, but the Portuguese
finally fled from the deck, leaving him
with only thirty men&mdash;English, French, and
Dutch&mdash;and he was obliged to ask for quarter.
The pirates then went down the coast
in their newly acquired ship and made several
prizes, some of which they burned and some
of which they sank. As they now mustered
nearly two hundred men, the only ones that
they forced from captured crews were carpenters,
calkers, and surgeons, whose services
they needed greatly.</p>

<p>Off the Cape of Good Hope they took two
Spanish brigantines, in whose company they
proceeded, until they ran the <i>Alexander</i>
ashore on a small island north of Madagascar,
where she stuck fast.</p>

<p>The Captain being sick in bed, the men<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
went ashore on the island and carried off
provisions and water to lighten the ship, on
board of which none but the Captain, the
quartermaster (Howard), and all others were
left.</p>

<p>This was too good a chance for the exercise
of Howard’s love of treachery. He brought
the faster of the two brigantines alongside,
tumbled all the treasure into her, scuttled
the other, and made off with twenty men and
two hundred thousand pounds, leaving the
rest of his shipmates to shake their impotent
fists and roar maledictions after his diminishing
sail.</p>

<p>After rounding the Cape, Howard and his
fellows went into a fine harbor on the east
side of Madagascar hardly known to European
vessels. Here they buried most of the
treasure, and for a short time enjoyed the
luxury of shore life. Wood and water were
abundant, game plentiful, and the waters
swarmed with edible fish.</p>

<p>It was pleasant to the pirate, after his long
trick afloat, to lie on the yellow sands under
the shade of palm and mango and tamarind<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
trees and see the slow surf breaking gently
on the beach. In his nostrils was the odor
of orange and spice; golden sunbirds and
crimson cockatoos nested above him, gaudy
butterflies floated about him, and in the shallow
waters of the still lagoons were long-legged
curlew, busy kingfishers, and wild duck
with tenderly shaded plumes. Behind him
the tropical jungles blazed gloriously with
trees of blooming scarlet and flaring yellow,
about which twined gorgeous creepers of dark
purple, and from whose leafy depths came the
chattering of monkeys and the twittering of
innumerable birds. Far off he could hear
the smothered thunder of lofty falls, near
at hand the plashing of rivulets, and seaward
the deep voice of the Indian Ocean.
The Malagasy women brought him cooling
fruits from the mountains, the hunters came
back laden with the flesh of wild cattle and
pigs and great, feathery bunches of waterfowl,
and the native king sent down to him
rice and bananas, maize and manioc, from
the rich store of his harvest.</p>

<p>After but a month of this happy shore life<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
they set sail, and running down the coast of
Africa met the English ship <i>Prosperous</i>, which
they captured by a night attack. The <i>Prosperous</i>
was a large, well-found ship of sixteen
guns, and well suited to Howard’s purpose,
so he transferred his crew and stores to her
and sailed to Maritan. They found there a
number of shipwrecked pirates, who, with
some of the <i>Prosperous’s</i> crew, took on with
them, and increased their complement to
seventy men.</p>

<p>They next steered for St. Mary’s, where
they wooded, watered, and shipped more
hands. Here they had an invitation from
one Ort van Tyle, a sturdy Dutch trader of
social ambition, to attend the christening of
two of his children. He received them with
hospitality and civility, but they had no
sooner entered his house than they began to
plunder it, and Van Tyle protesting, they
took him prisoner, and designed to hang
him, but one of the pirates aided him to
escape and he took to the woods. Here he
met some of his black; he armed them, and
formed an ambush on a scrubby island where<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
the river channel was narrow. The pirates
came down in their canoe and Howard’s pinnace,
laughing and shouting, bringing with
them the booty of the looted house and some
captives, whom they set at the paddles. The
canoe was overturned in the rapids just as
they came abreast of the ambush, and the
captives swam ashore and escaped, while the
pirates clung to the sides of Howard’s boat.
As they drifted by, Van Tyle let drive at
them, and in a shower of musket-balls, arrows,
and assagais the helpless pirates were
swept back to their ships, dismally howling
with rage and mortification. In this affair
two of Howard’s men were killed, while he
was shot through the arm, and two others
were seriously wounded.</p>

<p class="caption">THE HELPLESS PIRATES WERE SWEPT BACK</p>
</div>

<p>He then sailed to Mathelage, where he
designed to victual for a West-Indian cruise,
but he found there a large Dutch merchantman
of forty guns, whose captain curtly told
Howard to get out or he’d fall foul of him.
Howard’s recent experience with Dutchmen
had been unpleasant, so, as his vessel was
not strong enough to cope with the Amsterdamer,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
he made sail for Mayotta, and passed
down the bay amid a volley of gibes, jeers,
and ingenious Dutch profanity. On his way
to Mayotta he fell in with Captain Bowen, of
the pirate ship <i>Speedy Return</i>, of thirty guns,
and communicated to him the contumely to
which a “Gentleman of the Seas” had been
subjected. Bowen promised to avenge the
insult to their honorable craft, and accordingly
anchored in the dusk of the next evening
within hail of the irascible burgher. The
<i>Speedy Return</i> was a small ship for her armament
and crew, and this, with her suspicious
appearance, determined the Dutchman once
more to exhibit the bold front that he could
assume when there seemed to be no danger
in it. Accordingly he went to the rail and
bawled over the quiet waters, “Vot sheep is
dot, and vy for you don’d git oud to onced?”</p>

<p>“This is his Majesty’s cruiser <i>Haystack</i>,”
came the unruffled response, in Bowen’s clear
voice. “She has three decks and no bottom,
and sails four miles to leeward and one
ahead. Want to race?”</p>

<p>“Vot sheep is dot, and none of your tomfoolishness?”<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
roared the Teuton, purple with
rage.</p>

<p>“This is the <i>Flying Dutchman</i>, Captain
Vanderdecken, and the crew’s all ghosts,”
replied the pirate, in high glee. “Come
aboard and cheer up our spirits.”</p>

<p>This was too much. The Dutchman
mounted the rail and shrieked, hoarsely,
“I now asks you der last time for, vot sheep
you is, vere you vrom, and vot you to do
goin’ about to be?”</p>

<p>“This is the ship <i>Speedy Return</i>,” sang
out Bowen, “<em>from the seas</em>, and I’m goin’ to
fire a salute.”</p>

<p>The pirate then gave the word, and his
ship roared out a broadside that shivered
the Dutchman’s rail, smashed his boats, and
carried away his spanker-boom. The merchantman
waited no longer, but slipped his
cable and made off to sea, leaving the greater
part of his cargo ashore, where it was promptly
gathered in by the thrifty buccaneers.</p>

<p>Bowen now made sail for Mayotta, where
he joined the <i>Prosperous</i>, and the two ships
sailed together for the East Indies. After<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
some successes there they returned by separate
routes to Madagascar, for the purpose
of revictualling and refitting, agreeing
to meet again at St. John’s and lie in wait
for the Moorish fleet. They did this, and
one of the Moors fell a prize to Bowen, but
Howard did not come up with them till they
were anchored at the bay of Surat, where
they waited to lighten.</p>

<p>Howard came up among them slowly,
under shortened sail, and as he concealed
his men and kept his ports closed, they
took him for an English East-Indiaman and
suffered him to approach. Howard suddenly
attacked the largest vessel, and after a
desperate fight, in which he lost thirty men,
carried her by boarding.</p>

<p>On this vessel was a nobleman belonging
to the court of the Great Mogul. The prize
itself was immensely valuable, and the nobleman’s
ransom amounted to twenty thousand
pounds, so by this time Howard’s
fortune was well assured. He then ran
down to Malabar, where he met Bowen and
his prize, a fine, stout ship of sixty guns.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
The two captains with their quartermasters
held a consultation (on the night of their
meeting) in the cabin of the <i>Speedy Return</i>,
and their future plans were decided upon
over a rich banquet provided from the stores
of the prizes.</p>

<p>The <i>Prosperous</i> they sank and the <i>Speedy
Return</i> they burned, and in Bowen’s prize
they continued their depredations, the two
crews being joined together. This made
Howard’s ninth change of vessels since he
had taken to piracy.</p>

<p>As they cruised down the coast of Madagascar
they came in sight of Howard’s old
haven, where he had buried his treasure.
He became seized with a desire for shore
life, and with those of his men who had
lived there before with him, and with their
share of the recent booty, he went back to
his old stamping-ground to settle down. He
was received with open arms by his old
friends among the natives; he married a
Malagasy woman, and for a long time lived
quietly and peaceably, shooting, fishing,
watching his herds, and cultivating his fields.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
A missionary who was shipwrecked on the
coast about a year after Howard’s return
worked on the pirate’s soft heart so successfully
that before being taken home on a
trading-vessel that put in for water he had
brought the gallant buccaneer into the close
folds of the Roman Catholic Church and to
a full realization of his unusually sinful state.
After the missionary’s departure Howard
missed the theological discourse and dispute
that had whiled away many a tropic
twilight, and he knew not where to turn for
an outlet of his intellectual activities. Finally
the bright idea struck him that it would
be both pleasing and beneficial to evangelize
the natives. In a fit of religious enthusiasm
he proceeded to this work with his usual
prodigal hand. Unfortunately for himself, he
used a club in the process, and this, coupled
with his brutal treatment of his wife, made
him unpopular among the Malagasy.</p>

<p>One night the docile aborigines fell upon
him while he was asleep in his hammock,
and left mementos of their presence in the
shape of thirty-seven assagais stuck decoratively
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>in various parts of his body. When
found he was very dead, and thus terminated
the earthly career of a treacherous and unworthy
ruffian, whose only claims to our
consideration were his good seamanship and
Anglo-Saxon pluck.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="XI" id="XI"></a>XI<br />
TEW, OF RHODE ISLAND<br />
<i>A Fighter from the Seas</i></h2>

<p>On a lovely morning in the early
part of the eighteenth century
two vessels might have been seen
approaching each other at that
point where the northern waters of the
Mozambique Channel mingle with those of
the Indian Ocean. The day was mild and
the wind light and variable. The ships
rolled lazily on the languid swell, and a
couple of leagues to the south and east of
them the low, green shores of Madagascar
were dimly visible.</p>

<p>As the vessels drew near to each other
the smaller of the two, a large brig-sloop
with raking masts and a narrow, speedy-looking
hull, put down her helm, rounded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
into the wind, and ran the black flag up
to her main peak. The other, a trim and
sturdy ship-rigged craft, with something of
a man-of-war look about her lofty spars and
graceful lines, seemed little perturbed by
this significant display of the pirate emblem.
She hove to, however, and the two vessels
lay rolling idly on the blue water a long
musket-shot apart.</p>

<p>Before the sloop had time for any further
demonstration one of the ship’s quarter-boats
was lowered and brought to the starboard
gangway, and into her stepped a spare, dark,
wiry-looking man of medium height, evidently
the Captain. The boat shoved off and
made for the sloop, the Captain steering, and
the crew pulling with the long, regular stroke
of man-of-war’s men.</p>

<p>So far the ship had displayed no colors,
and the peculiar nonchalance with which
her crew had behaved towards the pirates
excited the latter’s marked apprehension.
Could she be a public ship in disguise? If
so, then farewell to the buccaneer’s hopes of
brave booty in the Indian seas, for the wind<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
had fallen and the vessels were drifting nearer
together.</p>

<p>The dark man seized the life-lines as they
were extended to him from the pirates’ gangway,
and climbed up the ladder with catlike
agility.</p>

<p>“What ship is this?” he asked, curtly,
ignoring the crew that pressed ominously
about him, and addressing himself to a tall
man of a quiet but commanding appearance
who stepped forward to meet him.</p>

<p>“This is the sloop <i>Hope</i>, sir, and I am her
commander, Thomas Tew, at your service.”</p>

<p>“And I am Captain Misson of the ship
<i>Victoire</i>, lately of his French Majesty’s service,
but now from the seas.”</p>

<p>The expression “from the seas” at once
allayed the fears of Tew’s pirates, for the
buccaneers of that day thus characterized
themselves in their answering hails.</p>

<p>The crew went about their duty, and the
two captains entered the cabin, where they
began a friendly conversation, and informed
each other of their respective histories.</p>

<p>It seemed that Mr. Richier, the Governor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
of Bermuda, had fitted out two sloops on the
privateer account, one commanded by Captain
George Drew, and the other by Thomas
Tew. They were instructed to make their
way to the river Gambia, in Africa, and to
attempt the taking of the French factory of
Goree on that coast. The vessels sailed together
and kept company for some time, but,
a violent storm coming up, Drew sprung his
mast and they lost each other.</p>

<p>Tew, separated from his consort, thought
of providing for his future with one bold
stroke. Accordingly he summoned his crew
to the mast, and addressed them upon the
subject of his plans.</p>

<p>He told them that they were afloat in a
fine craft bent upon a dangerous mission,
with no prospect of advantage for themselves,
but only for their employers. That
he was little inclined to risk his health and his
life except for some great personal gain, and
finally he proposed bluntly that they should
throw off their allegiance to Governor Richier,
and go “on the account,” as piracy was
called in those days.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
The crew listened eagerly, and at the conclusion
of his speech sung out as one man:</p>

<p>“A gold chain or a wooden leg. We’ll
stand by you, Captain.”</p>

<p>Tew then made sail for and doubled the
Cape of Good Hope, and as he entered the
Red Sea on his cruise northward came up
with a ship bound from the Indies to Arabia.
She was richly laden, and carried three hundred
soldiers to aid the crew in defending
her cargo; but, notwithstanding her superior
force, the pirates carried her with a dash, and
shared fifteen thousand dollars a man in
plunder. They then stood down the coast
towards Madagascar, and the <i>Victoire</i> was
the first ship they had sighted since leaving
their prize.</p>

<p>Misson listened with interest to Captain
Tew’s story, and then gave him a brief account
of his own adventures. He said that,
having gone to sea as a sub-officer on the
ship <i>Victoire</i> of the French royal service, he
had participated in an engagement with an
English man-of-war; that all his superior
officers had been killed in the action, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
that he had assumed command and sunk the
Briton; and that after this his crew had
requested him to retain command and go “on
the account” for himself. He confessed that
he had willingly acted upon their suggestion,
had made several prizes, and established a
colony on a bay to the northward of Diego
Suariez, on the island of Madagascar. He
informed Tew further that he was much impressed
with the courage with which the
<i>Hope</i> had borne down to engage a vessel so
much her superior in size and strength as
the <i>Victoire</i>, and that, as he could not have
too many resolute fellows as his allies, he
would be glad to join forces with Tew’s men.</p>

<p>Tew answered that before entering into an
alliance with Misson he would prefer to examine
the workings of the latter’s colony.
Misson agreed to this, and the <i>Victoire</i> and
the <i>Hope</i> sailed in company for Libertaita,
as Misson called his new republic.</p>

<p>Just at sunrise the two ships passed between
the fortified headlands that guarded
the entrance to the pirate stronghold, and
Tew, standing on his quarter-deck and following<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
the motions of the <i>Victoire</i>, was astonished
at the strength of the harbor he
entered, and the discipline that seemed to
prevail there.</p>

<p>With the timbers and guns of captured
ships Misson had constructed and armed
two powerful forts which stood on the headlands
at the entrance to the harbor. On a
little island, where the channel branched, a
brown earthwork pointed ten heavy cannon
so as to rake the seaward approaches, and
far back of it, on the edge of the bay, the
walls and roofs of a fortified town reared
themselves orderly amid the green of the
tropical foliage. Everywhere was the appearance
of industry and discipline. On a
beach near the town a group of sailors was
engaged careening a small brig to scrape the
sea-growths from her sides, another party
was filling water-casks at a well-constructed
reservoir, and the rattling of echoes of carpenters’
hammers came from a couple of
storehouses in process of construction near
the water’s edge. From a citadel in the
centre of the town and from flag-staffs erected<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
on both forts and the water-battery the
flag of Libertaita fluttered in the breeze,
vigilant sentries walked the ramparts with
military tread, and as the <i>Victoire</i> and the
<i>Hope</i> let go their anchors in the gentle
ground-swell of the harbor, a battery of
eighteen-pounders roared out a welcome of
nine guns.</p>

<p>Tew was charmed with the appearance of
the place, and upon going ashore with Misson
had his favorable impressions strengthened
and confirmed. The captains were received
with great respect by Caraccioli, Misson’s
lieutenant, who admired not a little the
courage that Tew had displayed in capturing
his prize and in giving chase to Misson.</p>

<p>The colony at this time was peopled by
over one thousand men, many of them having
been captured by Misson in his prizes.
Of these three hundred had taken on with
him, one hundred were natives of the island
of Mohilla, with whose queen Misson had
formed a matrimonial and political alliance,
and the remainder were prisoners whom
Misson intended to send to their homes, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
whom he employed in the mean time as
laborers around his fortifications.</p>

<p>The day after the arrival of the captains
at Libertaita a formal council was held.
Tew promptly expressed his willingness to
join forces with Misson, and was made second
in command.</p>

<p>The question of the disposition of Misson’s
numerous prisoners was brought up at once.
It was decided to tell them that Misson had
formed an alliance with a prince of the
natives, and to propose to them that they
should either assist the new colony or be
sent up the country as prisoners. On this
decision being imparted to them, seventy-three
of the prisoners took on, and the remainder
desired that they be given any
other fate than that of being sent up into
the wild and savage interior; so one hundred
and seventeen of them were set to
work upon a dock near the mouth of the
harbor, and the other prisoners, lest they
should revolt, were forbidden, under pain
of death, to pass certain prescribed bounds.
The <i>Hope</i> lay in the harbor as a guard-ship,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
and the Johanna men were armed and put
on patrol duty; but while the pirates were
providing for their protection they did not
forget their support, and large quantities of
Indian and European corn and other grain
were sowed in the fertile fields of Libertaita.</p>

<p>Soon after this it was decided to send away
the prisoners, as they were too much of a
burden for the infant colony. They were accordingly
summoned before the captains and
told that they were to be set at liberty.
Misson informed them that he knew the consequence
of giving them freedom; that he
expected to be attacked as soon as the place
of his retreat was known, and had it in his
hands to avoid further trouble by putting
them all to death; but that Captain Tew had
agreed with him to practise humanity, and
that they were to have their property restored
to them, and were to sail for a friendly
coast the next morning in a ship that was
well provisioned but unarmed. All he asked
was that they should never serve against him.
An oath to this effect was cheerfully taken,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
and away the prisoners sailed to the nearest
European settlement.</p>

<p>When they had gone Misson returned to
the work of improving his town, and gave
the command of his ship, the <i>Victoire</i>, to
Tew, who, with one hundred and sixty picked
fellows, set out to sweep the seas. He sailed
down the wind to the coast of Zanzibar, and
off Quiloa made up to a large ship which
backed her main-topsail and laid by for him.
Tew engaged her for four hours, losing many
men, but finding her a Portuguese public ship
of fifty guns and three hundred men, much
more than a match for the little <i>Victoire</i>, he
attempted to make off. The <i>Victoire</i>, however,
was so foul from her long service that
she could not show her customary clean pair
of heels, and the stranger, proving fast and
weatherly, drew up with her. The Portuguese
Captain, a gallant officer of great height
and herculean strength, lay alongside the <i>Victoire</i>
and boarded her at the head of his men;
but the pirates, not used to being attacked,
and expecting no quarter, made so desperate
a resistance that they not only drove back<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
the enemy with loss, but were enabled to
board in their turn. At first only a few followed
the Portuguese as they leaped back
into their own ship; but Tew, perceiving the
desperate resolution of these, sang out, “Follow
me, lads!” and sprang over his enemy’s
rail. The Portuguese opposed the pirates
firmly for a time, but to Tew’s cry, “She’s our
own! Board her! Board her!” his men replied
in continually augmenting numbers,
and drove the defenders back to the main-hatch.
Here a bloody conflict ensued, for
the Portuguese Captain fought in the front
rank of his men, and with voice and example
encouraged them to combat. Seeing this,
Tew rushed forward to meet him, and the
two captains crossed swords with equal
bravery. The crews paused to observe the
duel, and watched with fiercely excited eyes
the flashing sabres and shifting poises of their
champions. The Portuguese had a longer
reach, and was much taller and stronger than
the pirate, but the latter had the agility of a
panther, and was noted as one of the best
swordsmen of his day. Time and again the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
Portuguese made a dash against his adversary
with point or blade, only to be met with an
accurate parry or a quick return stroke that
forced him backward nearer and nearer to
the open hatch. Finally Tew parried a furious
lunge and delivered his terrible return
stroke on the neck of the Portuguese, who
threw up his hands and fell backward down
the hatch. This ended the fight, and the
crew of the public ship called for quarter.</p>

<p>With his rich prize, which yielded him
one hundred thousand pounds in Spanish
gold, Tew put back to port, where, notwithstanding
his severe loss, his courage and dash
were loudly acclaimed by the colony. Caraccioli
persuaded two hundred and ten of
the Portuguese to join the Libertaitans, and
among them, to Misson’s great pleasure, was
found a school-master, whose services he
at once devoted to the instruction of his
negroes.</p>

<p>Two sloops of eighty tons each had been
built in a creek, and when they were finished
they were armed with eight guns apiece out
of a Dutch prize, and sent on a trial trip.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
They proved to be fast, weatherly vessels,
and on their return from their first trip to
sea Misson proposed to send them out on a
voyage of survey to lay down a chart of the
shoals and deep water around the coast of
Madagascar. As Tew was an excellent navigator
he was given command of the expedition
and of one of the sloops, while the school-master,
who proved to be a good seaman and
skilful surveyor, commanded the other. The
sloops were manned with a crew of fifty
blacks and fifty whites each, and their four
months’ voyage enabled the negroes not only
to learn how to handle the boarding-pike,
but, as they were anxious to learn and be
useful, to pick up a fair knowledge of French
and seamanship. They returned with an excellent
chart and three prizes. Misson now
determined to make a foray in force, and,
dividing five hundred men, white and black,
between the <i>Victoire</i> and the <i>Hope</i>, he and
Tew set out for the high seas; of course a
strong force was left behind as a garrison.</p>

<p>Off the coast of Arabia Felix they fell in
with a ship of one hundred and ten guns belonging<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
to the Great Mogul. This ship carried
a crew of seven hundred men and nine
hundred passengers, and towered monstrously
above the low sides of the pirate vessels;
but Tew on the starboard quarter and Misson
on the port bore up gallantly, and engaged
her. To the opening broadsides of the
pirates she thundered an awful response.
Soon the wind died out, and thick clouds of
smoke lay motionless on the water; under
its cover Tew brought the little <i>Hope</i> alongside,
and, with his cutlass between his teeth
and his pistol in his hand, clambered up the
lofty side. He had barely reached the rail
when he was severely wounded and knocked
overboard by a pike-thrust. However, he
soon came to the surface, and managed, at
the head of a few of his men, to enter one of
his enemy’s lower-deck ports. In the mean
time Misson had boarded the Mussulman on
the port quarter, and a hand-to-hand fight
was going on over the rail. Misson was hard
pressed by numbers when Tew appeared from
the fore-hatch. One glance at this murderous-looking
figure, with bloody and smoke-grimed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
garments, rushing at them sword in
hand from behind, was enough for the Mussulmans,
and with a wild shriek of “Allah!”
they broke and fled down the hatches, leaving
the pirates in possession.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 320px;">

<p class="caption">HE WAS KNOCKED OVERBOARD BY A PIKE-THRUST</p>
</div>

<p>This proved a most valuable capture, as
over one million pounds, besides many rich
silks, spices, valuable carpets, and diamonds
were stored in the prize’s hold and strong-boxes.</p>

<p>The prisoners were landed at a point between
Ain and Aden, and the captured ship
brought back to Libertaita, where, as she had
proved a slow and unwieldly craft, she was
taken to pieces. Her cordage and knee-timbers
were preserved with all the bolts,
eyes, chains, and other iron-work, and her
guns were used in two strong water-batteries
as an additional support to the forts on the
headlands.</p>

<p>The colony was now in prime condition;
a number of acres had been enclosed, and
afforded pasturage for three hundred head
of cattle&mdash;a purchase from the natives, who
had begun to manifest a most friendly spirit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>&mdash;the
grain was ripening finely, the storehouses
and magazines were well under way,
and the dock was finished.</p>

<p>As the <i>Victoire</i> was foul from long service
and very loose from recent storms, she was
docked and practically rebuilt. When she
was floated again she was provisioned for a
long cruise, and was about to set out for the
Guinea coast when one of the sloops came in,
schooner-rigged, with the news that she had
been driven to port by five lofty ships, Portuguese,
of fifty guns each and full of men.</p>

<p>The alarm was given, the forts and batteries
manned, and the men put under arms.
Tew was given command of the English and
Portuguese, while Misson directed the French
and one hundred disciplined negroes. Slowly
and majestically the fleet swept on towards
the pirate stronghold; as they came within
easy gun-shot Tew leaped to the side of his
water-battery, and with both arms outstretched
stood waving in one hand the black
flag, and in the other the banner of Libertaita,
with its white albatross on a blue field.
A storm of solid shot greeted the daring<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
figure, but he leaped down unharmed, as
battery after battery and fort after fort
opened with a steady roar against the invader.
The Portuguese dashed by the forts
triumphantly, but wavered as they came
under the fire at close range of the heavy
guns of the water-batteries. They had
thought to carry all before them with one
bold dash, and after passing the headlands
had deemed victory assured, but here they
were in a hornets’ nest. Under the dreadful
fire from Tew’s and Misson’s skilful gunners
two of the Portuguese vessels were speedily
sunk. The others turned to flee; but they
were not to get off so easily. No sooner were
they clear of the forts than the pirates manned
both ships and sloops, gave them chase,
and engaged them in the open sea. The
Portuguese defended themselves gallantly,
and one of them, which was attacked by the
two sloops, beat off the Libertaitans twice;
two made a running fight and got off, and
the third was left to shift as she could. This
last, a fifty-gun ship of three hundred and
twenty men, defended herself till the greater<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
number of her crew were killed. Finally,
finding that she was left to an unequal fight,
she asked for quarter, and good quarter was
given. Thus ended Admiral X’s “holiday
jaunt to wipe out a nest of pirates,” as the
Portuguese Commander-in-Chief had described
his expedition in advance.</p>

<p>None of the prisoners were plundered, but,
on the contrary, the pirate captains invited
to their table the officers of the captured
ship, and congratulated them upon their
courage and ability.</p>

<p>For some months after this nothing occurred
to interrupt the quiet of the colony.
Finally, wearying of inactivity, Tew took the
<i>Victoire</i> and three hundred men and sailed
in search of prizes. Sixty miles from Libertaita
he found a strange colony of buccaneers.
The ship hove to and the Captain went ashore
alone to make the acquaintance of the strangers.
While he was absent from the ship a
great gale rose and blew the <i>Victoire</i> ashore
on a dangerous reef; she went down before
his eyes, carrying with her every man of the
crew.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
This was not the end of misfortune, for a
few nights afterwards the two Libertaitan
sloops appeared, and from one of them Misson
came ashore with disastrous news. The
same night that the <i>Victoire</i> went down the
natives had risen and destroyed Libertaita;
Misson had saved a quantity of diamonds
and bar gold, and fled in the sloops with the
remnant of his band; they were now without
a ship and without a haven.</p>

<p>The plunder and the men were equally
divided between the sloops, and the two
captains sailed in company for the coast of
America. Misson’s vessel went down with
all hands in a gale off Cape Infantes, but
Tew made a peaceful voyage to the British
colonies. He settled in Rhode Island, dispersed
his crew, and lived for a time unquestioned
with his wealth. He might have
reached an honored old age, with nothing to
recall the memories of his past, but at the
end of a few years he was persuaded to go
once more “on the account.” In the Red Sea
he engaged a ship of the Great Mogul, vastly
his superior in size and armament. During<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
the action Tew received a mortal wound, but
fought on as long as he could stand. When
he fell his men became terrified, and suffered
themselves to be taken without resistance.
They were all hanged; and so ended the last
of the Libertaitans.</p>

<h2><a name="XII" id="XII"></a>XII<br />
THE VROUW VAN TWINKLE’S KRULLERS<br />
<i>A Story of Old New York</i></h2>

<p>Clean, snug, and picturesque as
a Holland town was our city of
New York for some years after
it had dropped its juvenile name
of New Amsterdam and adopted its present
name; but not so suddenly could it change
its nature and Dutch ways. Dutch neatness
and the Dutch tongue still reigned supreme.
Substantial wooden houses turned gable ends
of black and yellow Holland bricks to the
front, until Pearl Street appeared like a triumphal
procession of chess-boards; while no
mansion in that then fashionable quarter
could boast more big doors and small windows
than that of the worthy burgher Van
Twinkle, and the little weathercock on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
roof was as giddy as any of its neighbors,
and as undecided as to which way the wind
actually did blow.</p>

<p>An air of festivity pervaded this residence
on a certain winter’s day in the early part
of the eighteenth century; windows were
thrown open, and Gretel, the eldest daughter
of the family, followed by black Sophy,
armed with brooms, mops, and pails, entered
that <i>sanctum sanctorum</i>, the best parlor,
to scrub and scour with unwonted energy;
for to-morrow would be that greatest of
Knickerbocker holidays, <i>Nieuw Jaar</i>, or New
Year, when every good Hollander would
consider it his duty to call upon his friends
and neighbors, and the front door with its
great brass knocker would swing from morning
till night to admit the well-wishers of
the season.</p>

<p>In the big kitchen also active preparations
were going forward. A royal fire blazed in
the wide chimney, and the Vrouw Van
Twinkle, in short gown and petticoat, was
cutting out and boiling those lightest and
richest of krullers for which she was famous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
among the good housewives of the town:
real Dutch krullers, brown as nuts, and crisp
as pie-crust.</p>

<p>“Out of the way, youngsters!” cried the
dame to a boy and girl lounging near to
watch the boiling, “or spattered will you be
with the hog’s fat. Take thy sister, Jan,
and off with her to the Flatten Barrack.
She would enjoy a good sledding this fine
day, and that I know.”</p>

<p>“Rather would I go to the skating on the
Salt River,” said Jan.</p>

<p>“But that you must not. It I forbid, for
very unsafe is it now, thy father did observe
only this morning.”</p>

<p>“Foolishness, though, was that, mother,”
argued Jan, “for last night Tunis Vanderbeck
from Breucklyn came over on the ice,
and told me that firm was it as any rock,
and smooth as thy soft, pink cheek.”</p>

<p>“Thou flatterer!” laughed his mother;
“but not so canst thou pull the wool over
my eyes; so away with you both to the
sledding, and here are two stivers with
which to buy New-Year cakes at Peter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
Clopper’s bake-house.” And diving in the
patchwork pocket hung at her side, Madam
Van Twinkle produced the coins, which sent
the children off with smiling faces to the hill
at the end of Garden Street, stopping on the
way to invest in the sweet New-Year cakes,
stamped with a crown and breeches.</p>

<p>Jan made short work of his; but Katrina
had scarce begun to nibble her fluted oval
when she spied an aged man, with a long
gray beard, begging for charity.</p>

<p>“See, Jan,” she cried, “the poor, miserable
old beggar! How cold and hungry he
looks!”</p>

<p>“Then to work should he go.”</p>

<p>“But it may be no work he has to do.
Ach! the sight of him makes my heart to
ache, and help him will I all I can.” So saying,
the kind-hearted girl darted to the mendicant’s
side and slipped her cake into his
hand.</p>

<p>“A thousand thanks, little lady!” exclaimed
the man, fervently; “for I am near to
starving, or I would not be here; and you
are the first who has heeded me to-day.”</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
He was evidently English; but Katrina
cared not for that, and, carried away by her
feelings, added a guilder, given her at Christmas,
to her gift of the New-Year cake, thereby
calling forth a shower of benedictions,
although the old fellow seemed strangely
nervous meanwhile, glancing in a frightened
manner at each passer-by. As soon as the
little maid’s back was turned he slunk into
a dark alley and out of sight.</p>

<p>“A silly noodle art thou, Katrina, thus to
throw away thy presents,” said Jan, as they
hurried on. But his sister only shook her
head, and smiled as though quite satisfied,
while her heart beat a happy roundelay all
the short December afternoon as she slid on
her wooden sled and frolicked with the little
Dutch Vans and Vanders on the Flatten-Barrack
Hill.</p>

<p>Twilight was falling when the young Van
Twinkles wended their way home, to find
their bread and buttermilk ready for them
by the kitchen fire, and their father and
mother and Gretel gone to a supper of
soft waffles and chocolate and a New-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>Year’s-Eve
dance at the Van Corlear Bouwerie.</p>

<p>“The best parlor, does it look fine and gay,
Sophy?” asked Katrina, as she finished her
evening meal.</p>

<p>“Dat it do,” replied the old slave woman;
“for waved am de sand on de floor like white
clouds, and de brass chair-nails shine jest
like little missy’s eyes. ’Spect de ole mynheer
and his vrouw come down and dance
dis night for sure.”</p>

<p>“What mynheer, Sophy?” asked Jan.</p>

<p>“De great mynheer in de portrait&mdash;your
gran’fader, ob course. Hab you chillens
neber heard how on New-Year Eve, when
de clock strike twelve, down come all de
pictur’ folkses to shake hands and wish each
oder ‘Happy New-Year,’ and den, if nuffin
disturb ’em, mebbe dey dance in de firelight.”</p>

<p>“Really, Sophy, do they?” asked the little
girl.</p>

<p>“Yah, dey do. Master Jan may laugh if
he please, but right am I. My ole moeder
hab so tole me, and wif her own eyes hab
she seen de ghostes dances.”</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
“A rare sight it must be! I wish that I
could see it,” said Katrina; and later, when
she went in to inspect the parlor, she gazed
up with increased respect at her stolid-faced
Holland ancestors.</p>

<p>“Much would I love to see them tread a
minuet!” sighed Katrina again, and even
after her head was laid on her pillow the idea
haunted her dreams, until, as the tall clock
in the hall struck eleven, she started up wide-awake,
with the feeling that something eventful
was about to happen.</p>

<p>“Almost spent is the old year!” she thought,
“and soon down the picture folk will come to
greet the new. Oh, I must, I must them
see!” and although the household was by this
time asleep, she crept out of bed, slipped on
her clothes, and stole noiselessly down-stairs.</p>

<p>“Still are they yet,” she whispered, glancing
up at the pictured faces. “But near the
hour draws, and hide I must, or they may
not come down, for Sophy says that spectators
they do not love. Ah, there is just the
place!” and running to the linen chest she
lifted the lid, and clambering lightly in,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
nestled down among the lavender-scented
sheets and table-cloths.</p>

<p>“A very comfortable hiding-spot, truly!”
exclaimed Katrina, as she placed a book
beneath the cover to hold it slightly open;
and so cosey did it prove that she grew a bit
drowsy before the midnight bells chimed the
knell of another twelvemonth. Then indeed,
however, she was on the alert in an instant
and peering eagerly out. Her corner was in
shadow, but the ruddy glow from the hickory
logs revealed the portraits still unmoved,
and she was about to utter an exclamation
of disappointment, when she was startled to
see a door leading to the rear of the house
suddenly swing open and the figure of a man
carrying a lantern enter with slow and
stealthy tread. An old man, apparently,
with gray hair and beard, and a sack thrown
across his shoulders. “’Tis the Old Year
himself!” thought the fanciful girl; but the
next moment she almost betrayed herself by
a scream as she recognized the beggar to
whom she had given her New-Year cake that
very afternoon.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
Slowly the midnight marauder approached,
and then, all at once, a wonderful transformation
took place. The bent form became
straight, the gray beard and hair were torn
off, and a younger and not unhandsome man
stood before the little watcher’s astonished
gaze.</p>

<p>She was too dumfounded to do anything
but tremble and stare, as the intruder seated
himself at the table and ate and drank, almost
snatching the viands in his eagerness.
His appetite appeased, however, he seemed
to hesitate; but then, with a muttered,
“Well, what must be must, and here’s for
home and Emily!” he seized a silver bowl
and dropped it into his bag, following it up
with the porringers and plates, that were the
very apple of the Dutch house-mother’s eye.</p>

<p>Too frightened to speak, poor little Katrina
watched these proceedings; but when the
thief laid hands on a certain old and beautifully
engraved flagon, she murmured: “The
loving-cup! the dear loving-cup! Oh, my
father’s heart ’twill break to lose that!”</p>

<p>“Plenty of the needful here!” chuckled the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
burglar; but a moment later he had his
surprise, for out of the shadows suddenly
emerged a small, slight figure, and a stern
voice cried, “Stop!”</p>

<p>With a startled exclamation the man fell
back, and then, as Katrina exclaimed, “The
loving-cup that is so old&mdash;ah, take not that!”
he dropped into a chair, ejaculating, “By St.
George, ’tis the little lady of the cake herself!”</p>

<p>“That is so,” said Katrina.</p>

<p>The man reddened. “Believe me, miss,”
he said, “I did not know this was your home,
or naught would have tempted me here; and
this is the first time I have ever soiled my
fingers with such work as this.”</p>

<p>“Then why begin now?” asked Katrina.</p>

<p>“Because I was down on my luck, and
there seemed no other way. Listen! For
two years I have served as a soldier in the
British army, and no more honest one ever
entered the province. I did not mind hard
work, but my health gave out, and at last the
rude fare and the homesickness I could stand
no longer, and three days ago I deserted from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
the English fort down yonder. The officers
are on my track, but, so far, disguised as an
old beggar, I have escaped detection beneath
their very noses. If caught I shall be flogged
within an inch of my life, and, it may be,
shot. Just over the water my wife and a
blue-eyed lass like you are longing for my
return, but, saving your guilder, I was penniless,
and so, for the first time, determined to
take what was not my own.”</p>

<p>“Poor man!” sighed Katrina, the tears
starting.</p>

<p>“To-morrow night the <i>Golden Lion</i> sails
for England. Her crew, after the New-Year
festivities, will be dazed at least, so I can
readily conceal myself until the ship is out
at sea. Then ho! for home and my little
Jeanie!”</p>

<p>“And as a bad, wicked robber will you go
to her?” asked the girl.</p>

<p>“No; indeed no!” cried the man, emptying
his sack. “You have saved me from that,
little lady, as well as from starvation to-day,
for I would not steal from you or yours.
Give me but these krullers to eat while I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
am a stowaway, and all the plate I will
leave.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that will I do,” said Katrina, rejoiced,
and she herself dropped the crisp
cakes into the man’s bag. “Now at once go,
and godspeed.”</p>

<p>“But first you must promise to mention
this meeting to no one until after the <i>Golden
Lion</i> weighs anchor at seven o’clock on New-Year’s
night.”</p>

<p>“To my mother may I not?” asked Katrina.</p>

<p>“No, no, to nobody! Oh, remember my
life is in your hands! Promise, I beg.”</p>

<p>His tone was so imploring the girl was
touched.</p>

<p>“I like it not, but I promise,” she said.</p>

<p>“Thank you. Farewell.” And again disguised,
the deserter departed, as he came, by
a back window.</p>

<p>Feeling as though in a dream, Katrina rearranged
the disordered table, and then,
creeping up to bed, fell so sound asleep that
she never heard Jan when he awoke the
household with his “Happy New-Years.”</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
Gayly the sunbeams glittered on the black-and-yellow
gables that 1st of January, and
fully as resplendent were the maids and
matrons of New York in their best muslins
and brocades; while Katrina presented a
very quaint, attractive little vision when she
came down in her taffeta gown and embroidered
stomacher, with her amber beads about
her neck. Her face was hardly in accord
with her attire, however, when she found
every one demanding, “What has become of
the krullers&mdash;the New-Year krullers?”</p>

<p>Madam Van Twinkle looked flushed and
angry. “The beautiful cakes with which I
so much trouble took!” she cried. “Ach! a
bad, wicked theft it is, and a mystery unaccountable.”</p>

<p>“Mebbe de great ole mynheer and his
vrouw gobbled ’em up,” put in Sophy.</p>

<p>“But what is worse,” continued the dame,
“in one big kruller, as a surprise, I did hide
a ring of gold sent to Gretel by her godmother
in Holland, and that too is whisked
away.”</p>

<p>At this Gretel also began to bewail the loss,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
and suggested that perhaps little black Josie,
Sophy’s son, was the miscreant.</p>

<p>“If so it be, to the whipping-post shall he
go!” cried the enraged Dutchwoman, starting
for the kitchen; but before she reached
the door Katrina exclaimed, “No, mother,
no; Josie is not the one.”</p>

<p>“Why, mine Katrina, what canst thou
know of this?” asked Mynheer Van Twinkle,
in amazement.</p>

<p>“I know&mdash;I know who has taken the
cakes,” stammered the blushing girl; “but
tell I cannot now.”</p>

<p>“Not tell!” gasped her mother. “Why
and wherefore?”</p>

<p>“Because my promise I have given. But
when the night comes, then shall you know
all.”</p>

<p>“Foolishness is this, Katrina,” cried the
good housewife, who was fast losing her temper
as well as her cakes, “and at once I command
you to say who has my New-Year
krullers.”</p>

<p>“And my ring from Rotterdam,” added
Gretel.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
“But that I cannot. A lie would it be.
Oh, my vader, canst thou not me trust until
the nightfall?”</p>

<p>“Surely, sweetheart. There, good vrouw,
say no more, but leave the little one in peace.
A promise thou wouldst not have her break.”</p>

<p>“Some there be better broken than kept;
but whom promised she?”</p>

<p>Katrina was silent, and now even her
father looked grave. “Speak, <i>mijn kind</i>;
whom didst thou promise?”</p>

<p>“I cannot tell.”</p>

<p>“See you, Jacobus, ’tis stubborn she is,
and wrong it looks. But list, Katrina; you
shall speak this minute, or else to your
chamber go, and there spend your New-Year’s
Day.”</p>

<p>At this mynheer puffed grimly at his pipe,
and Gretel would have remonstrated, but
without a word Katrina turned and left the
parlor. Ascending to her little attic-room,
she removed her holiday finery, and sat
sadly down to work on her Flemish lace, trying
to console herself by repeating: “Right
am I, and I know I am right. A promise<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
once given must not broken be,” while the
New-Year callers came and went, and the
sound of merry greetings floated up from
below.</p>

<p>So it was scarce a happy New-Year, and
the little weathercock must have pointed
very much to the east if he considered the
way the wind blew within-doors, for even
Jan turned fractious, and declared, “There
was no fun in calling on a parcel of old
<i>vrouws</i>,” and he should go to the turkey-shooting
at Beekman’s Swamp instead. But
this his mother forbade. “Shoot you will
not this day,” she said, “for at fourteen, like
a gentleman and a good Hollander should
you behave. So start at once, and my
greetings bear to the Van Pelts and Vander
Voorts and Mistress Hogeboom,” while his
father carried him off with him to call on
the dominie’s wife.</p>

<p>This visit over, however, they parted company,
and Jan lingered long in the market-place
to see the darkies dance to the rude
music of horns and tom-toms. Here he encountered
two of his chums, Nicholas Van<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
Ripper and Rem Hochstrasser, carrying guns
on their shoulders.</p>

<p>“Thee, Jan? Good!” they cried. “Now
come with us to the turkey-shooting. A
prize thou art sure to win.”</p>

<p>“But I started the New-Year visits to
make!” said Jan.</p>

<p>“And paid them in the market-place!”
laughed Nicholas. “Thou art a sly one,
Jan! But great sport is there at the Swamp
to-day; much better than the chatter of
the girls and a headache to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“So think I, Nick; but I have on my <i>kirch</i>
clothes;” and Jan glanced down at his best
galligaskins and his coat with its silver buttons.</p>

<p>“Not a bit will it hurt them; so come
along.” And thus urged, Jan joined his
friends, and was soon at Beekman’s Swamp,
where a bevy of youths were squandering
their stivers in the exciting sport of firing at
live turkeys.</p>

<p>Nick and Rem did well, and each bore off
a plump fowl, but luck seemed against Jan,
who could not succeed in even ruffling a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
feather; while at last he had the misfortune
to slip and get a rough tumble, besides soiling
his breeches and tearing a rent in the skirt of
his fine broadcloth coat.</p>

<p>“Ha! ha! What will Madam Van Twinkle
say to that?” laughed his unsympathetic
companions, when they saw Jan stamping
round, his little queue of hair, tied with an
eel-skin, fairly standing out with rage.</p>

<p>“Whatever she says, ’twill be your fault,
ye dough-nuts!” he shouted, and would have
indulged in some rather forcible Dutch epithets
had not his cousin Tunis Vanderbeck
come up at the moment, saying, “Mind it
not, Jan, but with me come to Breucklyn to
skate.”</p>

<p>“Yah; better will that be than facing the
mother in this plight,” said Jan; and he was
skating across the Salt River before he remembered
that he had been positively forbidden
to venture there.</p>

<p>“Sure art thou that the ice is strong,
Tunis?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Not so strong as it was. The thaw has
weakened it some, but ’twill hold to-night,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
if&mdash;” But at that instant an ominous cracking
sounded beneath their feet, and Tunis
had just time to glide to a firmer spot before
a scream rang through the air, and he looked
back to see the dark surging water in an
opening in the ice, and Jan’s head disappearing
beneath.</p>

<p>While, in the twilight, Katrina sat by her
window, thinking of blue-eyed English Jeanie,
she was startled by a voice on the shed roof
without calling, “Let me in, Katrina&mdash;let me
in;” and on opening the casement a very
wet and bedraggled boy tumbled at her feet,
sputtering out, “Run for dry clothes and a
hot drink, my Trina, for nearly drowned am
I, and frozen as well.”</p>

<p>The girl hastened to obey, and not until
her brother was snug and warm in her feather-bed
did she ask, “Whatever has happened
to thee, Jan?”</p>

<p>“Why, on the river I was, and the ice it
broke, and in I fell. But for an old cove
who risked his life to save me, in Davy
Jones’s locker would I be this minute; for
never a hand did Tunis Vanderbeck stir to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
help me, and unfriends will we be henceforth.”</p>

<p>“And thy <i>kirch</i> suit is ruined. Does the
mother know it?”</p>

<p>“No; for fear of her I came in by the roof,
but I met the father outside, and angry
enough he is because I went to the shooting
and on the river. He says that on bread
and water shall I live for a week, and to the
Philadelphia Fair shall I not go;” and a sob
rose in the boy’s throat. “But what is
queerest, Katrina, the old chap who pulled
me out seemed to know me, and gave me
this for you,” and Jan produced a moist,
soggy package, which, on being undone,
revealed a single broken kruller, in the centre
of which, however, gleamed a heavy gold ring.</p>

<p>“Good! good! Oh, glad am I!” cried Katrina;
and hastening to put on her festival
dress, when the clock chimed seven she went
dancing down to the parlor, and creeping to
her mother’s side, whispered, “Now, my
moeder, all will I tell thee.”</p>

<p>In amazement the family listened to her
story of the midnight visitor, and when she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
ended by slipping the ring on Gretel’s finger,
saying, “No common thief was he, for this
he sent me by Jan, whom he has saved from
a grave in the Salt River,” the Dutchwoman
caught her to her heart, sobbing, “Oh, my
Katrina, forgive thy mother, for it was in
my temper I spoke this morning, and a true,
brave girl hast thou been. To think that
but for thee our rare old silver would be on
its way to England!” Gretel too hugged her
rapturously, and the tears were in Mynheer
Van Twinkle’s eyes as he asked:</p>

<p>“How can I repay my daughter for saving
the loving-cup of my ancestors, and for her
lonely day above?”</p>

<p>“By forgiving Jan, father, and letting him
come to the New-Year supper. Disobedient
has he been, I know, but well punished is he,
and he is full of sorrow.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, for thee, it shall be so.”</p>

<p>So Jan was summoned down, and a truly
festal evening was held within the home
circle, beneath the gaze of the old mynheer
and his vrouw, who beamed benignantly from
their heavy frames.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
The <i>Golden Lion</i> sailed true to time, and
never again was the deserter heard of on
this side of the Atlantic; but for long after
Katrina was pointed out as “the blue-eyed
maid who saved the family plate and gave
away Vrouw Van Twinkle’s New-Year krullers.”</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="XIII" id="XIII"></a>XIII<br />
THE SIGN OF THE SERPENT<br />
<i>A Story of Louisiana in the Early Eighteenth
Century</i></h2>

<p>The two Vidals&mdash;the father Captain
and second in command at
Fort Rosalie,<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> and the son Jean,
who wore the stripes of a sub-lieutenant,
though his face had scarcely a
sign of beard on it yet&mdash;paced the parapet
of the fort in absorbed talk. Below them
rolled the brown flood of the Mississippi,
gilded into tawny gold by the setting sun.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
In the splendor of that glow stood out in
bold relief the galley which had arrived from
New Orleans that day. Young Jean, who
had been absent in the little Louisiana capital
for two months, and had received during
the visit his commission from Governor
Perier, had been a passenger, and was now
eagerly listening to the news of the fort.</p>

<p>“It is almost word for word as I tell thee,”
said the senior. “’Twas a month since that
Monsieur le Commandant sent for Big Serpent
to tell him the Governor’s wish, but not,
as Monsieur Perier would have chosen to
make it, the beginning of negotiation. For
all feel that it is not well the Natchez should
remain in power so near the fort. But Chopart’s
words were like the lash of the slave-whip.</p>

<p>“‘Does not my white brother know,’ answered
the Great Sun of the Natchez, ‘that
my people have lived in the village of White
Apple for more years than there are hairs in
the plaited scalp-lock which hangs from the
top of my head to my waist?’</p>

<p>“‘Foolish savage!’ said Chopart. ‘What<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
ties of friendship can there be between our
races? Enough for you to know that you
must obey your master’s orders, as I obey
mine.’</p>

<p>“‘We have other lands; take them, but
leave the village of White Apple to the
Natchez. There is our temple, there the
bones of our forefathers have slept since we
came to the banks of the Father of Waters,’
pleaded Big Serpent.</p>

<p>“‘Within the next moon comes the galley
from the big village of the French. If White
Apple is not then delivered to my soldiers,
and your people gone, the great chief of the
Natchez will be sent down the river, bound
hand and foot, to rot in prison. Go. I have
spoken,’ and Monsieur le Commandant waved
Big Serpent out of his presence.”</p>

<p>“And do the Natchez submit? Will Big
Serpent give up their beautiful village? Mon
Dieu! It’s a shame! It might have been
managed differently hadst thou been made
commandant instead of Chopart, <i>mon père</i>.”</p>

<p>“Tut! tut!” said the father. “Chopart
may carry his load, and welcome. ’Twould<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
have irked me much to have done the Governor’s
will, for, after all, ’tis the sword, not
the scabbard, which kills. Warning of treachery
and conspiracy has come from White
Apple, for thou knowest the old Princess had
a French husband and loves his race. Yet
her son, the chief, would bleed out every
French drop in his veins if he could. I like
not the signs, though only five days ago Big
Serpent came to Fort Rosalie, and when
Monsieur le Commandant flung the report of
foul play in his teeth, the chief smiled like a
baby in the face of its mother, and answered:
‘Let my brother believe what he sees. On
the seventh day hence my people will bring
thee more than the tribute due for the time,
thou hast granted, and will then give up
White Apple to the French.’ Yet Sergeant
Beaujean, who has been at the village since,
says there are no signs of preparation for
departure, and that warriors are pouring in
from all the outlying country. We shall
know in two days more. In the mean time,
Chopart reviles at all advice to keep the
garrison under arms, with closed gates and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
loaded cannon. The insolent calls doubters
cowards and old women. My sword should
answer that taunt,” continued the grizzled
soldier, fiercely, “were it not for a bad example
at this time. Big Serpent, though
young in years, is as old in guile as the most
ancient wiseacre of his tribe. So I fear to
have thee go to visit Akbal now, <i>mon fils</i>, for
the chief’s brother is sure to be deep in any
mischief brewing.”</p>

<p>“Better reason, then,” answered Jean, “to
make the venture. Time flies swiftly, and I,
surer than another, could go safely and might
find a clew to hidden danger. Yet ’tis hard
to break bread and play the spy.”</p>

<p>Captain Vidal paced up and down, his
features working in doubt, as the new
thought forced its way to acceptance. He
looked wistfully at his only son. “And thou
wouldst go there and pit thy young wits
against the Indian’s devilish cunning? Well,
it may do! Akbal was ever thy sworn
brother and hunting comrade.” So it was
arranged without further words, but the
father’s convulsive hand-clasp, when Jean,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
in hunter’s buckskins, bade him good-bye at
sunrise next morning, proved how loath he
was.</p>

<p>It was ten o’clock when Jean arrived in
White Apple, which was about fifteen miles
from Fort Rosalie. Eight miles lay through
the black muck of a swamp where even the
wariest foot and quickest eye found their
way with trouble. The foul morass into
which the river highlands sloped down on
the landward side gave the shortest road.
But its profusion of deadly reptile life wriggling
and hissing at every turn encompassed
the narrow path across the little knolls and
tussocks which give the only foot-grip, with
no slight peril to a blundering step. An
easier route meant nearly double the distance.</p>

<p>Almost the first greeting was that of Akbal,
but his manner was distant. He knew of
Jean’s long absence, but he asked no questions
with the tongue, though his eye was
keenly curious.</p>

<p>“I come to chase the buck with my friend
once more before the Natchez seek a new
hunting-ground,” said Jean.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
“Akbal not hunt to-day,” was the answer,
in broken French; “must listen to wisdom
of great chiefs in council. They meet even
now in the Temple of the Sun. Go; the
woods are full of deer and turkeys; but first
must eat, for Akbal’s friend much hungry
from his walk.”</p>

<p>This hospitable dismissal discomfited Jean,
for it seemed to close the gates to further
knowledge. The breakfast of venison and
sweet maize got no seasoning of cheer in the
gloomy looks of the boyish chief. Through
the door of the lodge the young Frenchman
saw the lines of Natchez warriors stalking
through the streets towards the temple, while
not a sound arose in the village. All moved
as silently as if they were a marching troop
of phantoms. Akbal sat patiently as a
bronze statue, waiting his guest’s motion to
depart.</p>

<p>In the centre of the village stood the temple&mdash;a
huge, round structure built of logs,
now wrinkled with years, and surmounted
with a cylindrical roof thatched with swamp-canes,
leaves, and Spanish-moss in an im<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>pervious
mat. It rose twenty feet higher
than the tallest lodges, and from one side
extended an arched thick-set hedge, embowering
a long passage to the adjacent forest,
a quarter of a mile away. Here the priests
and medicine-men of the Sun were wont to
seclude themselves from the rest of the
tribe.</p>

<p>The way to accomplish his quest suddenly
flashed on Jean’s mind. Once he parted
from Akbal, seemingly to plunge into the
forest, he could make his way to the exit of
the long, bowery avenue, and thence come
to the outside of the temple. There, it might
be, he could learn all he wished, though with
great peril to his life. So when the young
chief pressed his hand in a sad and silent
adieu, Jean, after a brief push into the tangled
brake, fetched a détour, and found himself
at the mouth of the passage. Through
its dusky green light he moved cautiously
forward to a coign of vantage. This he
found in the shrinkage of two ill-fitting logs,
which gave a space for seeing and hearing.</p>

<p>In the centre of the temple, on a rude stone<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
altar, smoked the unquenched fire which
had never died since the natal spark had
flamed in a Mexican temple two hundred
years before. This half a dozen hideously
painted priests fed with fragrant barks and
gums. Around them five hundred warriors
squatted on the ground, and passed the
council-pipe, while the priests mumbled
and chanted, and a portion of the sacred
band drew forth soft and monotonous music
from long reed instruments. A rattlesnake,
coiled around the right arm of the chief
priest, swayed its crest with an undulating
motion to the cadences of the music, and
its bright eyes seemed to watch every motion
with malign intentness, as if it were the
guiding spirit of the council. The braves
wore no war-paint, for their expedition was
not meant to blazon its own purpose; but
their faces, so far as they could be seen
through the smoke, were distorted with such
ferocity and lust of blood that they could
dispense with the help of pigments. And so
the priests chanted, and the players played
their soft melody, and the high-priest stroked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
his serpent’s hideous head as it curved and
swayed to the rhythm of the tune, while the
watching Jean was maddened by the delay
and the passage of time and opportunity.
At last, perhaps mindful of some signal from
the high-priest, the snake darted its full
length and struck with open mouth as if at
some enemy,<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> Big Serpent arose from the
seated ranks.</p>

<p>The Great Sun’s oration to his warriors,
spoken in the Indian tongue, was mostly
jargon to the listener, but he construed
enough of it to unravel the Natchez plot.
Under the guise of paying their tribute, they
would surprise the fort the next morning.</p>

<p>Jean waited for nothing more, but withdrew
swiftly, and dashed into the forest.
To reach Fort Rosalie as quickly as possible
he took his way again through the noisome
swamp which formed so much of the short-cut<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
to the French post. He had found his way
well towards the heart of that place of gloom
and reptilian life. Inspection of every tuft
of grass and weed now made progress slow,
and Jean looked forward to a few moments
of rest on the hummock twenty feet off which
projected from the edge of a canebrake.
How lucky, he thought, that he had escaped
without detection! On top of this thought
came the shock of a challenge, which made
his heart leap.</p>

<p>“<i>Halte, là!</i>” and the figure of Akbal pushed
through the reeds. His gun lay in the hollow
of one arm, and from the other hand dangled
a silver clasp with which Jean’s hunting-shirt
had been fastened, and which he had not
missed till this moment. It had been found
in the bowery lane near the temple.</p>

<p>“Better Akbal than another Natchez bring
this back to his French brother,” he went on,
with a note of mockery in his voice. “Jan
Akbal’s prisoner; no hurt him; to-morrow
set free.”</p>

<p>Quick as a flash Jean’s gun swung to his
shoulder.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
“Stand aside, Akbal, or I shoot you dead.
It must be that or pledge of free passage.”</p>

<p>The two stood like duellists with levelled
weapons, waiting for the word, with stern
faces and flashing eyes. This was not the
time nor place to remember old comradeship
and the rite of blood-brotherhood which had
once been solemnized between them. That
rite swore them to an undying amity, as if
born of the same mother and they had tasted
the red drops hot from each other’s veins in
testimony. But all this was forgotten. To
Jean, Akbal was the barrier to prevent his
saving the garrison. To Akbal, Jean was
the agent bent on foiling his people’s revolt
from French oppression. But though their
fingers touched triggers, they did not press
them. Perhaps this hesitation would have
lasted but a second.</p>

<p>But now Jean heard a whirring noise that
disturbed even his tense train of thinking
with a cold chill. He dashed his musket
butt at something, but it flecked him like a
giant whip-lash. A monstrous rattlesnake
had fastened its fangs deep in his thigh.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
Another duellist had stepped to the fore.
Akbal saw the snake spring, and was himself
almost as swift in leaping the interval. He
shook his head as he saw the enormous size
of the serpent, which was in the deadliest
season of its venom, wriggling with a broken
back.</p>

<p>“Much bad bite, but try save Jean,” said
he, as he helped him across to the larger
hummock. Luckily Jean’s canteen was full
of brandy, and this he gulped down eagerly,
while the Indian cut away the buckskin from
his leg. Two needle-point punctures, to be
sure, seemed scarcely worth bothering about,
but with an apology, “Knife much hurt, but
good,” he plunged the keen-edged blade into
the flesh, cutting out the envenomed parts,
and followed it by applying his lips and
sucking at the wound for a full five minutes.</p>

<p>“Fine weed sometimes cure snake-bite.
Big bush over there,” and he danced across
the bubbling marsh to a bog-oak with a thick
mass of green at its base. The swollen leg
and the pain which gnawed through the
drowsiness of the working venom told Akbal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
that there was no time to be lost. Flint and
steel quickly struck fire, and steeping leaves
and roots he made hot tea and a poultice. So
the Indian nurse fought the terrible poison in
the veins of the patient all that afternoon
and all the night long in the firefly-lit darkness
of that evil swamp.</p>

<p>The panther screams, which mingled harshly
with the subtler horror of things hissing and
splashing in the fetid pools, passed into the
dreams of Jean. Copper-colored fiends with
serpent heads storming the palisades of Fort
Rosalie and shrieking the Natchez war-whoop
sank their long curved fangs in the
body after the knife had rifled the head.
“<i>Mon père! mon père! sauve mon père!</i>” he
cried, in his agonized nightmare, and then
awoke, clutching Akbal’s arm in a sweat of
despair.</p>

<p>“Jan better now, stronger; no more bad
dream,” said Akbal, who recognized signs of
coming strength; and indeed when daylight
struggled into the swamp the color of the
French boy’s face had got back its lusty red.</p>

<p>“Come, come, we must hasten to the fort!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
I am myself once more,” and Jean stumbled
to his feet to fall back again with the sore
stiffness of his wounded thigh. Then he remembered
the meaning of Akbal’s presence
with a frown. The comrade-foe dragged the
heart out of that look with a word:</p>

<p>“Go soon. Akbal no stop Jan now.” He
spoke with a proud sadness and submission
in his tone. The serpent omen had come
from the Sun God&mdash;not even that deadly bite
could stop the young Frenchman’s return,
and he himself had been but the instrument
of duty. So he carefully bound the sore leg,
and they started across the boggy waste,
Jean leaning on his arm and limping with a
determined step. It took long to traverse
that quaking and slippery road, and the sun
climbed up the sky, and Jean became half
crazed with anxiety, for his leg would only
do so much work, with all the help of a human
crutch.</p>

<p>At last they emerged from the morass and
began to climb the upland, toiling on with
the fiercest energy of Jean’s tortured spirit.
Hark! that was the sound of cannon from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
the fort, and then they heard the faint crackling
of guns. “Too late!” half shrieked Jean
Vidal, and he sank on the ground with the
reaction, hopeless, helpless, and his face
streaming with tears of rage and grief. Akbal
dragged him to a sheltered place under
a bank, and leaped like a deer up the hill.
He believed in the sign of the Sun God, for
the rattlesnake was the totem of the Natchez
nation. He did not reason, in his simple,
superstitious loyalty, that he could have left
Jean to die of the serpent’s bite. He only
knew that he had been inspired to cure him.
Now he believed that the further mission of
salvation had been passed from Jean to him,
and the French blood in his veins warmed to
the dedication. The lives of the garrison
might yet be kept from the tomahawk and
the torture stake.</p>

<p>The fort was already in the hands of the
Natchez when Akbal arrived on the bloody
scene. The murdering crew gathered to his
assembly whoop, with Big Serpent at their
head. He told the story of the supposed
miracle with fervent eloquence, and the lives<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
of those who had not already fallen in battle
were spared, including Captain Vidal, for
these bloodthirsty warriors of the Natchez
were pious in their way, and believed the
sign of the serpent. Jean Vidal, too, remembered
the stroke of that terrible fang with
something like superstitious gratitude. Had
it not been for that he and Akbal would
probably have slain each other where they
stood, and every Frenchman in the fort
would have been butchered or reserved for
a more fiendish death. As it was, Chopart
was the only one to suffer execution, and he
justly expiated the deeds of a cold-blooded
tyrant.</p>

<h2><a name="XIV" id="XIV"></a>XIV<br />
A DRUMMER OF WARBURTON’S<br />
<i>How a Boy Held Fort George at Cape Canso,
in 1757</i></h2>

<p>A few hours ago I found an odd-shaped
bit of blackened brass.
The thing lies before me now as
I write. It is a drum-hook. I
know this for the simple reason that I was
once a drummer-boy myself, and could not
be mistaken regarding such a familiar object.
I found this drum-hook among a lot of other
odds and ends at the bottom of a well in an
old, long-abandoned fortification. The poor
scrap of silent metal brings to mind the tale
of Rupert Haydon, drummer-boy in one of
the old line regiments. His deed of heroism
was performed at this same old fort which I
have to-day been ransacking. Perhaps this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
drum-hook was once used by him! It is not
at all unlikely.</p>

<p>By turning to your map of North America
you can easily distinguish Cape Canso, at
the eastern extremity of the mainland of
Nova Scotia. Upon an island, about a mile
from the shore and forming with it the harbor
of Canso, is the grass-grown fortress which
I have mentioned. The name of the island
is George’s; the fort has had several high-sounding
titles. Why should it not? It is
old&mdash;older perhaps than others with claims
of easier proof. In 1518, over a century before
the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth, legend
says that Baron de Lery threw up the first
embankments and claimed the country for
the crown of France. Several times this
fort has been besieged and captured, at
heavy loss of life. New England sent expeditions
against it. The bloodthirsty Indians
repeatedly raided the place. In 1745
Pepperell and his valiant little army of
Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Connecticut
militia remained here for some weeks,
in order to acquire drill and discipline before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
moving upon the boasted Louisburg. And
many another martial display has this neglected
old fort witnessed, and personages
celebrated in our history have walked within
its ramparts upon occasion.</p>

<p>In the year 1757 Fort George, as it was
then called, had as its garrison a small detachment
from Colonel Warburton’s regiment of
foot. This trifling force was compelled to
watch over a wide extent of territory in addition
to the special place they occupied.
France and England were again at war, and
both regular expeditions and lawless guerillas
abounded.</p>

<p>On a certain day in midsummer the garrison
embarked upon a small vessel and sailed
away to the relief of a threatened settlement.
Rupert Haydon, the drummer-boy, was left
in charge of the fort. With him were several
women, wives of soldiers, and their small
children.</p>

<p>“We shall be gone but a week at most,
drummer,” Captain Peabody had announced.
“It suits me not to leave women and stores
so ill protected, but the commands of my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
superiors must be obeyed. However, it is
scarce likely that the enemy will have knowledge
of the fort’s weakness in time to profit
thereby.”</p>

<p>The drummer-boy stood at attention and
saluted as the soldiers marched out through
the covered way. With the aid of the women
he hoisted the drawbridge and closed the
massive timber gates. Then, scrambling up
on top of the parapet, he watched the little
sailing craft, her decks all bright with the
scarlet-coated warriors, pass out through the
narrow harbor entrance and disappear from
view around the first headland. Scarcely
had the transport so vanished, when Rupert’s
keen eyes discovered another vessel making
for the harbor from the opposite side.</p>

<p>Mere supposition was useless. The newcomer
might prove to be a friend. If an
enemy, the chance of being let alone was
problematical. It was now too late to recall
the recently departed garrison. Upon the
drummer’s young shoulders lay the whole
burden of maintaining the dignity of the
English flag.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
Rupert Haydon was only a poorly educated
boy, but he must have had a great deal of
latent talent. Even while gazing in consternation
at the fast-approaching vessel, he
mentally mapped out a plan of campaign.
Hastily gathering the women about him, he
explained the matter to them, and secured
their aid. They were all well used to the
happening of the unexpected, and inured
to danger and fatigue. The wife of a British
soldier has never had an easy lot. These
rugged-looking though golden-hearted women
donned some uniforms left behind by their
husbands, and became, in outward appearance
at least, full-fledged soldiers. The six
small cannon mounted in the fort’s bastions
were loaded, small-arms served out, and
ammunition placed conveniently to hand.
One of the soldier-women mounted guard
upon the ramparts, and marched up and
down, in plain view, with musket upon
shoulder. The English ensign was, of course,
flying from the tall staff in the centre of the
redoubt.</p>

<p>As the vessel drew nearer, the little garrison<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
began to bustle with activity, and continued
in the same fashion for some while.
Two of the soldier-women would come out
of the fort, stroll down to the shore, examine
the stranger with an apparently mild
curiosity, and then walk off together over
the hills. Meanwhile the others, including
Rupert, would come and go, disappearing
and reappearing in all directions with the aid
of the rocky ravines and clumps of trees upon
the island. The idea of all this was to convince
the new-comers, whoever they might
be, that the fort’s garrison remained unimpaired,
and took no special notice of a single
vessel. That the scheme had a certain effect
was shown in the fact that the stranger came
to anchor far down the harbor, well out of
range of Fort George’s cannon. It looked
very much as if the appearance of these
redcoats coming and going about the island
had impressed her commander unfavorably.</p>

<p>After some delay the ship hoisted a French
ensign, and a small boat put off from her
side and headed for the fort landing. This
boat contained three men&mdash;two rowing, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
one in the stern holding aloft a piece of white
cloth. It was evidently a flag of truce, coming
to parley.</p>

<p>Although his worst fears were now realized,
and they plainly had a formidable enemy to
deal with, Rupert never wavered, but proceeded
to dispose of his forces in the best
manner possible. Leaving only the sentry
upon the parapet, he marched out of the fort
at the head of the others, as if they merely
constituted a suitable escorting party. One
of the squad he had equipped beforehand
with a flag of truce similar to that carried
by the man in the boat. The drummer drew
up his little company in a single rank upon
the glacis, about half-way between the intrenchments
and the water’s edge. At such
a distance their disguises could not be discovered.
Alone he advanced to the border
of the pebble-strewn strand, and there awaited
the coming of the emissary.</p>

<p>The latter was wary of approaching too
hastily. He bade his oarsmen back the
skiff stern first to within ten or fifteen yards
of the shore. Then he stopped them, and,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
while they kept the boat in position with
gentle strokes, he held converse with the
intrepid drummer by means of lusty
shoutings.</p>

<p>“I wish to speak with your Commandant,”
began the stranger, using good English,
yet with a decided Gallic accent. “You
are only a child.... A drummer-boy?...
Am I not right?... I judged so by your small
stature and pretty coat.... Inform the Commandant
of your fort that I desire a few
words with him.”</p>

<p>“It is impossible,” replied Rupert, coolly.</p>

<p>“What? Impossible?”</p>

<p>“Yes; I regret to say that the Commandant
will not be able to see you at present. But
I am his representative, and can also act as
your messenger if you have something of
importance to transmit.”</p>

<p>“O-ho! We are very high and mighty, it
seems!” retorted the stranger, angrily. “Like
should have like for meals. I will not be
so civil as I first intended. Tell your Commandant
that my name is Rabentine&mdash;Captain
Rabentine. I have the honor of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
commanding <i>La Belle Cerise</i>, privateer, of
St. Malo.”</p>

<p>“A French privateer!” ejaculated Rupert.</p>

<p>“Just so,” went on Captain Rabentine,
looking from the drummer to his escort, up
at the fort, and back again to the drummer,
with some appearance of suspicion.</p>

<p>“I had thought you were a navy frigate,”
rejoined Rupert, promptly. “We are getting
rusty for the want of a little fighting.”</p>

<p>The other seemed slightly taken aback at
this statement.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you may have such a chance even
yet,” he growled.</p>

<p>“Well, Captain Rabentine,” cried the boy,
courteously, “what else am I to say to the
Commandant? For surely you took not all
this trouble merely to let us know whom our
visitor might be?”</p>

<p>“Inform him,” shouted the privateer Captain,
waxing wroth, “that I had intended
simply to lay in harbor here and weather out
the coming gale. That a good prize-ship
is more to my liking than an empty fort!
Perhaps there might even have been a case<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
of rare wine sent ashore by way of compliment.
But as he chooses to be so distant,
and sends a drummer-boy as fitting ambassador
to a French Captain, I shall give
myself the pleasure of&mdash;But, pshaw! there
is no money in this for my owners. Inform
your Commandant that I have a mind to
anchor farther up the harbor, where the
shelter is good, for a few days. That I will
not molest him if he leaves me alone. There
you have it in a nutshell. Go, and haste
quickly with the answer.”</p>

<p>Gravely turning on his heel the drummer
strode back up the hill, joined his waiting
escort, and marched with them to the fort.
He was gone upon this pretended mission
some little time; quite long enough further to
exasperate the privateer Captain.</p>

<p>“Truly ’tis a matter of wonderful ceremony,”
he sneered, when Rupert, after repeating
the former precautionary measures
with his escort, was once more at speaking
distance. “All this folderol is wearisome.
Your Commandant may regret not having
sent an officer before we are through with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
thing. Did you sufficiently impress him
with the fact that I am not one to be trifled
with? Does he realize that his garrison can
scarcely outnumber my crew? <i>La Belle
Cerise</i> carries one hundred and fifty-four as
natty sailors as ever swung boarding-pikes,
and at a pinch we can spare a round hundred
for landing-party and still have enough on
board to work our biggest guns. He should
be thankful that I show an inclination to
leave his puny fort untouched. What has
he to say?”</p>

<p>“Our two nations being at war at the
present time,” announced the drummer,
guardedly, “I am to tell you that we can
offer no harbor unless you care to surrender
yourself and crew as prisoners, and your ship
as lawful prize. Failing this, you must&mdash;”</p>

<p>“What? Zounds!” howled the easily excited
Frenchman. “Your Commandant may
think this good jesting, but I do not share his
opinions. Tell him to look to his defences.
The flag of France shall once more wave
above them. We will attack at once, and for
every poor fellow I lose in this worthless<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
assault, two of your survivors shall be strung
up to die. Give way, my boys!” he cried,
addressing his oarsmen.</p>

<p>The boat sped off to the vessel. The
drummer and his little party returned within
the fort, and prepared as best they could for
what was to follow.</p>

<p>Almost immediately after the arrival of the
privateer Captain on board his ship, three
great pinnaces were lowered to the water
and filled with men. The glitter from naked
cutlasses, inlaid pistols, and carefully held
muskets could easily be distinguished among
them. This flotilla was soon ready, and at
once started for the fort landing. Luckily
for the trivial band of defenders the wind was
increasing to such an extent that Captain
Rabentine did not consider it wise to attempt
manœuvring his ship in an unbuoyed and
dangerous harbor. Therefore the flotilla
was without any aid from the guns of <i>La
Belle Cerise</i>. Moreover, the waves were
commencing to run high, and the overloaded
boats labored heavily. It was necessary to
keep them headed to the seas as much as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
possible, and, in consequence, their progress
towards the shore was rendered extremely
slow.</p>

<p>Rupert Haydon and his improvised garrison
were all ready. The loaded cannon were
trained as nearly as could be upon the approaching
boats. The women soldiers had
kissed their children a fond good-bye, and
shut them up in the bomb-proof magazine,
away from danger of flying projectiles.</p>

<p>When the flotilla had arrived within easy
range, the young drummer commenced discharging
the battery as fast as he could pull
the lanyards. After him hurried the women,
reloading the heated cannon. The roar of
the discharge came re-echoing back from the
rocky cliffs repeated over and over again,
and the smoke-clouds temporarily hid the
fort from view.</p>

<p>This unskilful volley went wide of the
mark, as was to be expected under the circumstances,
and yet inflicted great damage
upon the privateersmen. The thing came
about after the following fashion: Upon
the very beginning of the cannonade, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
officer in command of the leading boat had
bade his rowers swing their craft directly
head on to the fort, thus presenting as small
a target as possible. Those in the second
boat, however, more intent upon watching
the course of the projectiles than anything
else, had not noticed this manœuvre, and so,
before anything could be done to prevent it,
came smashing against the other’s gunwale.
In the heavy sea then running this was
specially disastrous. The stricken boat had
her side stove in, and the on-comer was overturned.
Both crews quickly found themselves
struggling in the water. Well convinced
of the hopelessness of continuing their
present assault, the men in the remaining
pinnace confined their efforts to rescuing
drowning comrades and getting out of range
again as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>The gale had now increased considerably,
and its gathering force gave promise of still
fiercer might. By the time the survivors
of the boat expedition had returned to their
ship the day was drawing close to twilight.
Captain Rabentine well realized his double<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
danger. Failing shelter, which could only
be found farther up the harbor, and in range
of the fort’s cannon, he must put to sea. He
was wild with anger at his repulse. What
would have been his condition of mind if
he had known that the defenders consisted
merely of a boy and a few women dressed in
soldier clothes?</p>

<p>Hastily ordering the cable slipped, Captain
Rabentine saw to the spreading of some small
storm-sails, and tried to beat out of the inhospitable
harbor. But even here fortune
seemed to be against him. The full flood-tide
was running, and although <i>La Belle
Cerise</i> strutted bravely, she could make no
perceptible offing. The only road to safety
lay directly past the fort and out the other
entrance. The privateer Captain well knew
that one lucky shot might disable his ship,
and cause him to lose control over her. In
such a wind and upon such a coast this meant
almost certain death and destruction. But
it appeared to be his only chance, and he
had to take it.</p>

<p>Down on the wind swept the privateer.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
Her decks were awash with foam. She
rolled and pitched like a mad thing. Her
guns were lashed fast to the deck ring-bolts.
It would have been suicidal to try to use
them in such a sea. The crew clung to
shrouds and railings, gazing ruefully upon
the nearing battlements which they had so
unsuccessfully attempted to assail. In a few
minutes they were almost abreast of the
green hill. Scarcely a hundred yards distant
were the grinning embrasures, from which
protruded the muzzles of cannon in plain
view.</p>

<p class="caption">SHE ROLLED AND PITCHED LIKE A MAD THING</p>
</div>

<p>Within the fort Rupert Haydon stood
ready, lanyard in hand. The guns had been
more carefully sighted this time, and he felt
sure that they could not all miss such a
monstrous mark. One pull upon the blackened
cord and the chances for a prosperous
voyage of <i>La Belle Cerise</i> of St. Malo would
be small. For a second he hesitated. Then
dropping the lanyard, cried:</p>

<p>“No, no. It would be murder, not battle.”</p>

<p>Seizing the white flag of truce that had already
been used in the preliminary negotiations,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
and leaping upon the parapet, he
waved it to and fro.</p>

<p>The meaning was instantly comprehended
on board of the privateer. Not to be outdone
in courtesy, some sailors, at risk of life
and limb, scrambled aft to their own halyards.
As the ship swept by, the proud ensign
of France descended to the deck in
salute to the drummer-boy of Warburton’s.
Ere it was hoisted again, <i>La Belle Cerise</i>
was a receding speck upon the darkening,
storm-swept ocean.</p>

<h2><a name="XV" id="XV"></a>XV<br />
ROGERS’ RANGERS<br />
<i>The Famous New Hampshire Scouts of the
Old French War</i></h2>

<p>Rogers’ Rangers were a
famous partisan corps during the old
French War. Besides the regular
forces employed, there were
irregular or partisan bodies, composed of Canadian
French and their Indian allies on one
side, and English frontiersmen on the other.
They acted as scouts and rangers for either
army, guarding trains, procuring intelligence,
and intercepting supplies destined for the
enemy. Both were composed of picked men,
skilled in woodcraft, and excellent marksmen.
One of Rogers’ companies was composed
entirely of Indians in their native
costume.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
The Rangers were a body of hardy and
resolute young men, principally from New
Hampshire. They were accustomed to hunting
and inured to hardships, and from frequent
contact with the Indians they had
become familiar with their language and customs.
Every one of these rugged foresters
was a dead shot, and could hit an object the
size of a dollar at a hundred yards.</p>

<p>There was no idleness in the Rangers’
camp. They were obliged to be constantly
on the alert, and to keep a vigilant watch
upon the enemy. They made long and
fatiguing journeys into his country on snow-shoes
in midwinter in pursuit of his marauding
parties, often camping in the forest
without a fire, to avoid discovery, and without
other food than the game they had
killed on the march. On more than one
occasion they made prisoners of the French
sentinels at the very gates of Crown Point and
Ticonderoga, their strongholds. They were
the most formidable body of men ever employed
in Indian warfare, and were especially
dreaded by their French and Indian foes.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
It was in this school that Israel Putnam,
John Stark, and others were trained for
future usefulness in the struggle for American
Independence. Several British officers, attracted
by this exciting and hazardous as
well as novel method of campaigning, joined
as volunteers in some of their expeditions.
Among them was the young Lord Howe, who
during this tour of duty formed a strong
friendship for Stark and Putnam, both of
whom were with him when he fell at Ticonderoga
shortly afterwards.</p>

<p>Major Robert Rogers, who raised and commanded
this celebrated corps, was a native
of Dunbarton, New Hampshire. Tall and
well proportioned, but rough in feature, he
was noted for strength and activity, and was
the leader in athletic sports, not only in his
own neighborhood, but for miles around.</p>

<p>Rogers’ lieutenant was John Stark, afterwards
the hero of Bennington. When in his
twenty-fourth year Stark, while out with a
hunting-party, was captured by some St.
Francis Indians and taken to their village.
While here he had to run the gauntlet. For<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
this cruel sport the young warriors of the
tribe arranged themselves in two lines, each
armed with a rod or club to strike the captive
as he passed them, singing some provoking
words taught him for the occasion,
intended to stimulate their wrath against the
unfortunate victim.</p>

<p>Eastman, one of Stark’s companions when
he was taken, was the first to run the gauntlet
and was terribly mauled. Stark’s turn came
next. Making a sudden rush, he knocked
down the nearest Indian, and wresting his
club from him, struck out right and left,
dealing such vigorous blows as he ran that
he made it extremely lively for the Indians,
without receiving much injury himself. This
feat greatly pleased the old Indians who were
looking on, and they laughed heartily at the
discomfiture of the young men.</p>

<p>When the Indians directed him to hoe corn,
Stark cut up the young corn and flung his
hoe into the river, declaring that it was the
business of squaws and not of warriors.
Stark was at length ransomed by his friends
on payment of £100 to his captors.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
During the Revolutionary war Stark’s services
were rendered at the most critical moments,
and were of the highest value to his
country. At Bunker Hill he commanded
at the rail fence on the left of the redoubt,
holding the post long enough to insure the
safety of his overpowered and retreating
countrymen. At the capture of the Hessians
at Trenton he led the van of Sullivan’s division,
and at Bennington he struck the decisive
blow that paralyzed Burgoyne and
made his surrender inevitable.</p>

<p>Skilful and brave as were the Rangers,
they were not always successful. The French
partisans, under good leaders, with their wily
and formidable Indian allies, well versed in
forest strategy, on one occasion inflicted dire
disaster upon them.</p>

<p>Near Fort Ticonderoga, in the winter of
1757, Rogers with 180 men attacked and dispersed
a party of Indians, inflicting upon
them a severe loss. This, however, was but
a small part of the force which, under De la
Durantaye and De Langry, French officers
of reputation, were fully prepared to meet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
the Rangers, of whose movements they had
been thoroughly informed beforehand. The
party Rogers had dispersed was simply a
decoy.</p>

<p>The Rangers had thrown down their
packs, and were scattered in pursuit of the
flying savages, when they suddenly found
themselves confronted with the main body
of the enemy, by whom they were largely
outnumbered and of whose presence they
were wholly unsuspicious. Nearly fifty of
the Rangers fell at the first onslaught; the
remainder retreated to a position in which
they could make a stand. Here, under such
cover as the trees and rocks afforded, they
fought with their accustomed valor, and
more than once drove back their numerous
foes. Repeated attacks were made
upon them both in front and on either flank,
the enemy rallying after each repulse, and
manifesting a courage and determination
equal to those of the Rangers. So close was
the conflict that the opposing parties were
often intermingled, and in general were not
more than twenty yards asunder. The fight<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
was a series of duels, each combatant singling
out a particular foe&mdash;a common practice in
Indian fighting.</p>

<p>This unequal contest had continued an
hour and a half, and the Rangers had lost
more than half their number. After doing
all that brave men could do, the remainder
retreated in the best manner possible, each
for himself. Several who were wounded or
fatigued were taken by the pursuing savages.
A singular circumstance about this battle
was that it was fought by both sides upon
snow-shoes.</p>

<p>Rogers, closely pursued, made his escape
by outwitting the Indians who pressed upon
him&mdash;such at least is the tradition. The
precipitous cliffs near the northern end of
Lake George, since called Rogers’ Rock, has
on one side a sharp and steep descent hundreds
of feet to the lake. Gaining this point,
Rogers threw his rifle and other equipments
down the rocks. Then, unbuckling the straps
of his snow-shoes, and turning round, he
replaced them, the toes still pointing towards
the lake. This was the work of a moment.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
He then walked back in his tracks from the
edge of the cliff into the woods and disappeared
just as the Indians, sure of their
prey, reached the spot. To their amazement,
they saw two tracks towards the cliff,
none from it, and concluded that two Englishmen
had thrown themselves down the
precipice, preferring to be dashed to pieces
rather than be captured. Soon a rapidly
receding figure on the ice below attracted
their notice, and the baffled savages, seeing
that the redoubtable Ranger had safely effected
the perilous descent, gave up the chase,
fully believing him to be under the protection
of the Great Spirit.</p>

<p>By a wonderful exercise of his athletic
powers, Rogers, availing himself of the projecting
branches of the trees which lined the
rocky ravines in his course, had succeeded
in swinging himself from the top to the
bottom of this precipitous cliff. It was
a fortunate escape for him, for if captured
he would surely have been burned
alive.</p>

<p>In this unfortunate affair the Rangers had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
eight officers and one hundred men killed.
Their losses, however, were soon repaired,
and they continued to render efficient service
until the close of the war.</p>

<h2><a name="XVI" id="XVI"></a>XVI<br />
THE PLOT OF PONTIAC<br />
<i>How Detroit was Saved in 1763</i></h2>

<p>The long contest between England
and France for the right to rule
over North America, which lasted
seventy years, and inflicted untold
misery upon the hapless settlers on
the English frontier, was at last brought
to an end. England was victorious, and
in 1763 a treaty was made by which
France gave up Canada and all her Western
posts.</p>

<p>With the exception of the Six Nations, the
Indian tribes had fought on the side of the
French, whose kind and generous course had
won their affection. But the claims to the
country which they and their forefathers
had always possessed were utterly disregarded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
by both parties. Said an old chief
on one occasion:</p>

<p>“The French claim all the land on one
side of the Ohio, and the English claim all
the land on the other side. Where, then,
are the lands of the Indian?”</p>

<p>The final overthrow of the French left the
Indians to contend alone with the English,
who were steadily pushing them towards the
setting sun. Seeing this, and wishing to rid
his country of the hated pale-faces, who had
driven the red men from their homes, Pontiac,
the great leader of the Ottawas, determined&mdash;to
use his own words&mdash;“to drive the dogs
in red clothing” (the English soldiers) “into
the sea.”</p>

<p>This renowned warrior, who had led the
Ottawas at the defeat of General Braddock,
was courageous, intelligent, and eloquent,
and was unmatched for craftiness. Besides
the kindred tribes of Ojibways, or Chippewas,
and Pottawattomies, whose villages were
with his own in the immediate vicinity of
Detroit, a number of other warlike tribes
agreed to join in the plot to overthrow the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
English. Pontiac refused to believe that
the French had given up the contest, and
relied upon their assistance also for the
success of his plan.</p>

<p>All the English forts and garrisons beyond
the Alleghanies were to be destroyed on a
given day, and the defenceless frontier settlements
were also to be swept away.</p>

<p>The capture of Detroit was to be the task
of Pontiac himself. This terrible plot came
very near succeeding. Nine of the twelve
military posts on the exposed frontier were
taken, and most of their defenders slaughtered,
and the outlying settlements of
Pennsylvania and Virginia were mercilessly destroyed.</p>

<p>On the evening of May 6, 1763, Major
Gladwin, the commander at Detroit, received
secret information that an attempt
would be made next day to capture the fort
by treachery. The garrison was weak, the
defences feeble. Fearing an immediate attack,
the sentinels were doubled, and an
anxious watch was kept by Gladwin all that
night.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
The next morning Pontiac entered the
fort with sixty chosen warriors, each of whom
had concealed beneath his blanket a gun,
the barrel of which had been cut short. His
plan was to demand that a council be held,
and after delivering his speech to offer a
peace belt of wampum. This belt was worked
on one side with white and on the other
side with green beads. The reversal of the
belt from the white to the green side was to
be the signal of attack. The plot was well
laid, and would probably have succeeded
had it not been revealed to Gladwin.</p>

<p>The savage throng, plumed and feathered
and besmeared with paint to make themselves
appear as hideous as possible, as their
custom is in time of war, had no sooner passed
the gateway than they saw that their plan
had failed. Soldiers and employés were all
armed and ready for action. Pontiac and
his warriors, however, moved on, betraying
no surprise, and entered the council-room,
where Gladwin and his officers, all well
armed, awaited them.</p>

<p>“Why,” asked Pontiac, “do I see so many<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
of my father’s young men standing in the
street with their guns?”</p>

<p>“To keep the young men to their duty, and
prevent idleness,” was the reply.</p>

<p>The business of the council then began.
Pontiac’s speech was bold and threatening.
As the critical moment approached, and just
as he was on the point of presenting the belt,
and all was breathless expectation, Gladwin
gave a signal. The drums at the door of the
council suddenly rolled the charge, the clash
of arms was heard, and the officers present
drew their swords from their scabbards.
Pontiac was brave, but this decisive proof
that his plot was discovered completely disconcerted
him. He delivered the belt in the
usual manner, and without giving the expected
signal.</p>

<p>Stepping forward, Gladwin then drew the
chief’s blanket aside, and disclosed the proof
of his treachery. The council then broke up.
The gates of the fort were again thrown open,
and the baffled savages were permitted to
depart.</p>

<p>Stratagem having failed, an open attack<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
soon followed, but with no better success.
For months Pontiac tried every method in
his power to capture the fort, but as the
hunting-season approached, the disheartened
Indians gradually went away, and he was
compelled to give up the attempt.</p>

<p>In the campaign that followed, two armies
were marched from different points into the
heart of the Indian country. Colonel Bradstreet,
on the north, passed up the lakes, and
penetrated the region beyond Detroit, while
on the south Colonel Bouquet advanced from
Fort Pitt into the Delaware and Shawnee
settlements of the Ohio Valley. The Indians
were completely overawed. Bouquet compelled
them to sue for peace, and to restore
all the captives that had been taken from
time to time during their wars with the whites.</p>

<p>The return of these captives, many of whom
were supposed to be dead, and the reunion
of husbands and wives, parents and children,
and brothers and sisters, presented a scene of
thrilling interest. Some were overjoyed at
regaining their lost ones; others were heartbroken
on learning the sad fate of those dear<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
to them. What a pang pierced that mother’s
breast who recognized her child only to find
it clinging the more closely to its Indian
mother, her own claims wholly forgotten!</p>

<p>Some of the children had lost all recollection
of their former home, and screamed and
resisted when handed over to their relatives.
Some of the young women had married Indian
husbands, and, with their children, were unwilling
to return to the settlements. Indeed,
several of them had become so strongly attached
to their Indian homes and mode of
life that after returning to their homes they
made their escape and returned to their
husbands’ wigwams.</p>

<p>Even the Indians, who are educated to
repress all outward signs of emotion, could
not wholly conceal their sorrow at parting
with their adopted relatives and friends.
Cruel as the Indian is in his warfare, to his
captives who have been adopted into his
tribe he is uniformly kind, making no distinction
between them and those of his own
race. To those now restored they offered
furs and choice articles of food, and even<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
begged leave to follow the army home, that
they might hunt for the captives, and
supply them with better food than that
furnished to the soldiers. Indian women
filled the camp with their wailing and lamentation
both night and day.</p>

<p>One old woman sought her daughter, who
had been carried off nine years before. She
discovered her, but the girl, who had almost
forgotten her native tongue, did not recognize
her, and the mother bitterly complained
that the child she had so often sung to sleep
had forgotten her in her old age. Bouquet,
whose humane instincts had been deeply
touched by this scene, suggested an experiment.
“Sing the song you used to sing
to her when a child,” said he. The mother
sang. The girl’s attention was instantly
fixed. A flood of tears proclaimed the
awakened memories, and the long-lost child
was restored to the mother’s arms.</p>

<p class="center">Each Post 8vo, Illustrated, with Introduction, 60 cents.</p>

<p class="center">AMERICAN HISTORICAL FICTION FOR BOYS AND GIRLS</p>

<p>These books tell thrilling stories of the personal life
and heroic deeds of Americans in the great struggles
of Colonial times, the Revolution, 1812, and 1861,
which have welded together and built up the American
nation. They are full of a close human interest and a
dramatic quality which cannot be imparted in compact
histories, although these tales are usually founded upon
actual historical events. They enlist and hold the attention
of readers, and they also clear the historical perspective
and convey lessons in courage and patriotism.
Mr. George Cary Eggleston’s successful “Strange Stories
from History” deals in part with heroes of other nations,
but these books, while similar to that in many respects,
tell of those whose gallant deeds gave us the America
of to-day.</p>
